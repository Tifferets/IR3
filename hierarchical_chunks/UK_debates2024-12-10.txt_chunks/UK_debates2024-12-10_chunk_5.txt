members across house may wonder first- cousin marriage already illegal.
fact, many house country may already believe.
understandable, early middle fifth century england, church practised roman doctrine first- cousin marriage, clarified first archbishop canterbury early eighth century, received letter pope gregory.
letter cited leviticus 18:, sacred law forbids man uncover nakedness near kin.
throughout centuries followed, canon law forbidding first- cousin marriage remained norm, 11th century extended sixth cousins., 000- year tradition first- cousin marriage illegal continued 1540, king henry viii broke rome legalised marriage first cousins could marry catherine howard, fifth wife cousin second wife, anne boleyn.
sadly, catherine anne ended facing swift end block.
however, law pertaining first- cousin marriage enduring, remaining unchanged ever since.
today, according oxford journal law religion, cousin marriage practised 10% world prevalent middle east, west asia north africa.
however, practice varies enormously within countries regional culture, reaching highest 80% parts rural pakistan.
contrast, china western countries less%.
patrick nash, visiting fellow oxford university' faculty theology religion, describes region' history harsh conditions, resource- scarce rurality, proximity conflict zones industrial poverty, plays major role developing cultures practise first- cousin marriage.
argues cousin marriage one time biologically beneficial survival mankind, times especially hard inhospitable.
however, carry forward modern living conditions post- industrial age, genetic degenerative diseases among severe threats public health.
