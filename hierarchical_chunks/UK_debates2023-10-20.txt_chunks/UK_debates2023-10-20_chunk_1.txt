workplace sexual harassment blights society.

victims report, fear believed damaging working relationships career prospects.
although sexual harassment confined women, vast majority victims women.
harassment devastating impact victims.
nearly half women harassed work said harmed mental health.

nearly one five left job result treatment.
every person safe sexual harassment, every day new stories expose extent problem workplaces.
year, torrent misconduct allegations prominent companies organisations.
remain questions answered cbi, odey asset management, royal national lifeboat institution, fire services, national crime agency even nhs..
lady making important speech powerful topic.
former nhs employee 30 years, aware poor practice lack control certain individuals sexual predators.
small minority, massive impact nhs workers.
agree must protect precious nhs staff stamp sexual harassment workplaces?
could agree.. lady points individuals damage reputation whole organisation, especially comes nhs, devastating.
bill good organisations protects well.. lady clarify—i sure remarks far—whether favour lords amendment, speaking?
come later, supporting lords amendments.
many good employers implemented measures safeguard employees.
however, far many done enough prevent punish sexual harassment.. friend making powerful speech issue, says, blighted workplaces.
agree part problem employers act harassment begins low level?
putting workers, talking belittling start grows.
often past, people moved different department.
bill put end sort atmosphere workplace?
yes, beginning culture change prevent sexual harassment happening gets point damaging effects.
equality human rights commission found nearly half cases reported employer took action, minimised incident placed responsibility employee avoid harasser.
one also finds employer really know.
bill becomes law, guidance employers know exactly expected.
help organisations face problems.
thank.
lady giving way, making important speech.
protecting people, especially women, harassment hugely important.
government fantastic track record bringing legislation protect vulnerable people.
strong concerns bill unamended state, particularly making employers responsible third- party harassment.
however, yesterday contacted denise rossiter, chief executive essex chambers commerce, ask opinion essex businesses.
message received back clear: local essex employers warmly welcome amendments made bill place.
delighted government backed.
welcome amendments, particular lords amendment, support bill amended state.
thank.
lady intervention pleased come point across houses pass bill, amended, law.
come amendments later speech hear say.
current laws sexual harassment mean employers often adopt individualised responses institutional problems.
creates space employers minimise going leads confusion respond appropriately.
45% managers felt supported organisation reports made.
ultimately, current laws protect people encountered traumatic experiences.
must better.
bill strengthen legislative protections workplace sexual harassment.
help create safer working environments fit 21st century.
introduces standalone duty employers take responsible steps prevent sexual harassment within organisations.
make real difference, require employers take proactive steps address sexual harassment.
help instil culture change, ensure people abuse women others longer rely workplaces turning blind eye.

say big thank baroness burt solihull, worked tirelessly place ensure bill got stage.
thanks also go team government equalities office, whose constant advice encouragement outstanding.
finally, thank team sticking.
speak lords amendments, undoubtedly narrowed scope bill.
lords amendment, tabled lord hannan kingsclere, removes clause bill, getting rid proposed liability employers third- party harassment workplace.
means incidents third- party harassment continue covered law, extreme cases resulting clear personal injury criminal offence committed.
legal situation remain since third- party harassment protections repealed 2013.
personally think shame.
lords amendment, tabled baroness noakes, narrows concept “all reasonable steps” simply “reasonable steps”.
practical steps employer might take would substantially.
example, employers might consider implementing effective equality policy, providing anti- harassment training dealing effectively employee complaints, among things.
difference wording means tribunals would apply lower threshold assessing breach employer duty compared original drafting bill.
equality act 2010 already contains statutory defence requires employment tribunal assessment whether employer took reasonable steps determine legal liability.
amendment change equality act' existing statutory defence, create different test new duty employers prevent sexual harassment.
employer duty still send strong signal employers need take action prioritise prevention sexual harassment ultimately improve workplace practices cultures.
cannot stand say completely happy amendments, accept bill would progress law, would lot worse.
peers place reached understanding baroness burt solihull: ensure passage sexual harassment preventive duty, accepted amendments discussion today.
longer takes legislation preventing sexual harassment become law, workers—especially women—will left risk workplace sexual harassment.
would simply acceptable.
face continuous scandals, lawmakers cannot stand nothing.
bill passed law, beginning much- needed culture change.
grateful guidance fawcett society wider alliance women, continue support bill substantial difference make women' lives.
without support guidance, would able take revised bill forward.
groups remain disappointed clause would provided protection third- party harassment taken forward.
fully accept disappointment.
protections essential give businesses organisations clarity need make workplaces safe everybody.
hope debate bill encouraged businesses organisations recognise make significant difference protecting staff harassment customers clients.
remains unfinished business, discussion moving forward important get cross- party support houses, keep saying accepting lords amendments.
government' survey sexual harassment found every day.
million people face sexual harassment third party work—that even consider scale forms third- party harassment, example racist homophobic nature.
continue make case protections third- party harassment put place, hope government listen continue work fawcett society wider alliance women bring required legislation forward next.
content today reached consensus pragmatic way forward.
vital send clear signal sexual harassment workplace acceptable steps taken prevent.
grateful cross- party support particularly support government.
ask house accept lords amendments bill pass law.
one wait longer vital step towards safer respectful workplaces.
propose divide house today happy got place bill effectively gutted lordships.
happy cross- party consensus got.
right removed third- party liability, something regrettable way bill developed.
good moment, response pressure lordships, government proposed introduce new defence equality act harassment, whereby possible defend suit grounds intention injure injured party, merely overheard conversations civil discussions, among colleagues customers, liable legal action.
good step; developed improved equalities law.
response pressure place, government withdrawn third- party liability measure, good thing.
agree.
friend member southend west( anna firth) position abstain opposing bill.
however, need debate equalities framework country.
fundamentally, need stop bringing forward call performative legislation intended simply outlaw behaviour disapprove, immoral conversations, bad manners, action likely cause hurt distress.

consequence criminalising bad manners—even bad manners—is fundamentally curtail free speech freedom upon civility society depends.
glad discussion respectful way, work.
recognise discussion may enough need little time..
gentleman think legislation guides better behaviour, reason, important pass certain laws?

important discussion.. lady saying law teacher—indeed, is—and influences culture.
also true law needs reflect culture, modernise legislative framework response public opinion things.

relief bill back today, given reported earlier year likely shelved, possibly backlash heard.
bill come back place, albeit heavily amended, still represents step right direction, albeit small one.. member bath( wera hobhouse) done sterling job getting bill parliamentary maze.
extremely gracious generous comments today, given left bill.
think fine description say narrowed scope.
alternatively, could described,.
member devizes( danny kruger) done, guts ripped.
know description suits happened better.
quite contrast bill started journey house.
bill never criminalising free speech; tackling real live issue workplace.
bill started passage, members rightly spoke unison appalling scale nature sexual harassment' workplaces.
indeed, deeply concerned numbers women facing harassment work.
latest data government show nearly one three employees experienced form sexual harassment previous year.
means.
million women year experience harassment workplace, know impact victims profound.
know lead variety harms, including psychological, physical economic harms, often perpetrators get away.
according recent data, 41% perpetrators sexual harassment see sanction.
meanwhile, 17% sexually harassed end working elsewhere due experiences.
2023, good enough.
figures speak parliamentary intervention needed.
glad supporting bill.. friend talks women subject sexual harassment, know problem endemic, also seems, increasingly, young men reporting falling foul that—even place.
really important recognise men, particularly younger men, victims well.
yes, absolutely right.
equality act framed way protects everyone harassment basis sex.
think bill, amendments, regret protect workers third- party harassment.
duty take reasonable steps reduced watered taking reasonable steps.
disappointed bill returns form looks different originally passed house.
seems original good intentions bill have—to use terms.
member devizes—been “gutted”, sorry say seems support government.
let forget, bill passed commons originally, support government also cross- party support, rarity days.
therefore, extremely disappointing democratically elected house seems given unelected lords, seemingly endorsement government.
say government' decision support lords amendments taken guts bill frustrating, given bill enacting pledges government made.. gentleman recognise bill.
member bath( wera hobhouse) decide amendments accept?
government fully supported.
lady.
government decision; part parliamentary process.
thank minister comments.
government majority, wanted keep bill original form could ensured passed.
let quote said committee stage.
said “the government committed package new measures aimed reducing incidences workplace harassment. includes two legislative measures brought forward bill: explicit protections employees workplace harassment third parties, customers clients; duty employers take reasonable steps prevent employees experiencing sexual harassment. ”––[ official report, worker protection( amendment equality act 2010) public bill committee, 23 november 2022;.

government decided change mind?
seems folded pressure back benchers.
let forget bill came result extensive government consultation, received, 000 responses.
necessarily come government' defence, think.
gentleman tying knots argument.
amendment passed house lords.
noticed, sure, government majority house, cannot held responsible amendment passed.
government done asked overturning lords amendment, bill would fallen altogether, entirely sure arguing.
sure.
member aware vote regularly lords amendments place, government use majority overturn.
point trying make: leave government policy issue?
fawcett society found 56% women working hospitality sector, 47% working services industry, faced sexual harassment workplace.
government?.
gentleman wished press matter vote point principle, could vote lords amendment.
sure.
friend member devizes( danny kruger) would delighted, would guarantee whole bill fell.
really wants?, want, said oppose amendment, still entitled express disappointment capitulation.
equality human rights commission' 2018 report found “a quarter reporting harassment saying perpetrators third parties” third- party sexual harassment dealt poorly considered “a ‘normal’ part job” employers.
think situation defend.
let clear: would objected bill place—we certainly would supported it—but support stands,.
member bath said, important step right direction, albeit much smaller step originally intended.
question remains: government' plan deal third- party harassment?
bring forward legislative solution, intend?
repeat scenes presidents club tomorrow, would consequences perpetrators?
need answers questions.
despite removal word “all” bill, duty prevent sexual harassment,.
member bath said, new duty represents positive step forward.
establishing preventive duty shift emphasis away reliance individuals reporting harassment employers encourage employers take preventive steps.
optimistic—we be—and hope bill drive structural change fundamentally shifting responsibility individual institution, mean reality much capacity ehrc investigate complaints remains seen.
responsibility create statutory code practice mean focus working employers.
minister information expects statutory code practice published, bill passed, draw mainly non- statutory code practice already produced?
believe everyone able go work safe sexual harassment, knowing employer taken steps create safe working environment.
labour government would go much house today.
congratulate.
member bath( wera hobhouse) progressing bill, tackles important issue sexual harassment workplace.
thank pragmatism shown ensure bill progress agreement across house.
slightly disappointing see shadow minister,.
member ellesmere port neston( justin madders), take partisan approach, bill cross- party support throughout stages.
often difficult private members' bills pass place, government fully supported bill, important issue tackle.
especially made time additional sitting friday, ensure bill passes.
remain committed tackling sexual harassment workplace introducing employer duty, strengthen protections equality act 2010.
note concerns.
friends members southend west( anna firth) devizes( danny kruger), pleased consensus reached place, hope members agree important bill statute book.
would like particularly thank.
friend member devizes, genuine concerns bill expressed today previous stages.
difficult subject.
may differences views opinions, really pleased.
member bath able progress bill houses, need make workplaces better safer.
particularly true women.

hat health minister, particularly pleased legislation hopefully prevent experiences future.
turn lords amendments.
lords amendment leaves clause, remove proposed liability employers third- party harassment workplace.
glad hear amendment remove third- party harassment liability eases concerns could chilling effect free speech workplace.
pleased addressed.
some—i know.
member bath one them—who disappointed amendment removed third- party harassment liability, valid reasons, getting compromise, get majority measures bill place.
government believe important workers protected form harassment, good employers already taking steps ensure employees protected harassment third parties, regardless legal position.
however, progress bill, pragmatic, acknowledge complexities play find suitable balance.
want strengthen protections, also wish infringe individuals' rights freedom speech.
everyone right views debate today, respecting others' views process.
aim bill tackle workplace harassment limit people' freedoms.
important remember, despite removal third- party harassment provision, bill still introduce new duty employers take reasonable steps prevent sexual harassment.
government' priority ensure legislation works effectively.
consistently consulted wide range stakeholders listened views.. friend member southend west consulted chamber commerce, government done widely.
concerns regarding potential chilling effect free speech first raised bill progressed commons, government took board issues.
feared employers may take unreasonable drastic measures avoid liability harassment staff, particularly third parties, extent would feel obliged shut conversations workplace.
employers expected take action workplace harassment, recognise actions fall short prohibiting conversations.
free speech crucial way life, important found way forward.
40 amendments tabled bill place following second reading 24 march, even government tabled amendment, clear remained concerns bill would still chilling effect free speech.
government took amendments seriously, fatal bill.
engagement stakeholders peers, heard strong concern, particularly third- party harassment issues, eager find balance way forward bill reach statute book cross- party support.
therefore, government pragmatic alive issues raised, consensus reached peers removing two amendments.
shadow minister,.
member ellesmere port neston, comment amendments—over 38 them—that managed get removed.
14 july committee, lords amended bill remove proposed liability employers third- party harassment workplace, asking members support today., said along introducing protection third- party harassment.
remembered still introducing new duty employers take reasonable steps prevent sexual harassment workplace, hope.
members see strengthening protections, alive concerns place.
accepted lords amendment 2—to leave word “all” clause, page, line 27—which changes requirement employers respect duty prevent sexual harassment taking “all reasonable steps” taking “reasonable steps”.
understand removal “all” means duty go far.
member bath would originally liked, reassure members place introduction duty employers take reasonable steps prevent sexual harassment strengthen protection workers.
close, touch concerns expressed.
friend member devizes.
important say government recognise sexual harassment workplace exists, protecting free speech important, constantly hear experiences, day day out—particularly experiences women,.
member bristol east( kerry mccarthy) touched harassment men well.

friend indeed colleagues believe passionately people keeping earn., need ensure government money spent.
need ensure always spent prudently delivers maximum return possible ordinary taxpayers.
also true, hope would join recognising, many public sector workers source real pride country—from healthcare workers nhs armed forces front line local government officials important work local communities.
services paid taxpayer, indeed taxpayers, seek take responsible balanced approach conditions offered public sector workers.
government sought every pay round.
2023- 24 round, accepted headline pay recommendations independent pay review bodies full armed forces, teachers, prison officers, police, judiciary, medical workforces senior civil servants.
workforces, accepting recommendations resulted highest pay uplifts three decades, providing fair reward workers fair deal taxpayers employers alike.
exit payments, redundancy, aspect.
help employers make necessary organisational change, regularly happens private sector, support individuals uphold employment law leave employment.
however,.
friend absolutely right taxpayer ultimately foots bill individual payments.
many times larger average earnings elsewhere public sector, absolutely right—i hope support across house—that look fair proportionate payments, particularly time falls government make difficult responsible decisions public finances.
government share concern overall level spending exit payments, particularly number large exit payments made individuals recent years.
committed limiting large exit payments making provision recovery payments appropriate.
minister also give assurance large exit payments never agreed public sector workers facing disciplinary proceedings choose leave instead facing disciplinary proceedings?
assure big exit payments given circumstances?
thank.
friend, doughty champion value taxpayers' money, makes important point.
commitment give goes rather broadly, government seek make sure exit payments always offer value money every pound taxpayers' money well spent.
responding ultimately consultation government conducted almost year ago, ensure point raised fully addressed.. friend says government committed something, 2023, 2015 government first resolved something must done obscenely high public sector exit payments excess 95k.
intervening period, government place, wonder whether minister could tell result recent action, consultation paper august 2022.

friend makes fair point pace government able proceed.
write, following important intervention, latest prognosis.
hope also recognise correct say government done nothing.
chief secretary treasury, right.
friend member salisbury( john glen), speak, leading important piece work productivity across public sector spending.
colleagues government endeavouring every day ensure every pound government money well spent.. friend recall—this important get right—that past attempts always delivered desired results.
2020, government laid legislation—notwithstanding prolific endeavours, know.
friend general big advocate government constantly legislating—but 2020 government legislated introduce cap payments.
subsequently withdrawn following unintended consequences, risk overriding conflicting people' contractual entitlements.
let clear:.
friend absolutely right intention.
minister says write me—i always love receiving letters, particularly him—but government known bill order paper.
introduced june last year, august last year government issued consultation paper said, “everybody must respond paper 17 october 2022, thereby indicating sense urgency.
happened response consultation?
surely minister give answer, rather saying write later.
often case, sometimes better right quick.
given government absolutely understand share.
friend' concerns, much better bring forward response consultation, celebrate.

( rebecca harris.)
debate resumed friday 27 october.
second reading beg move, bill read second time.
serious issue, first raised house back summer 2021, 21 june, presented called covid- 19 vaccine damage bill.
bill given short second reading debate friday 10 september 2021, time described “about suffered injury even death result enlisting war covid vaccinated.
went say: “there lot damage done citizens result covid- 19 vaccinations vaccination programme history.
mean…that worth, am…not anti- vaxxer…but important, people right thing, denied access to” —reasonable— “compensation”.
[ official report, 10 september 2021; vol. 700,.
630- 631.] pay tribute.
friend campaign behalf many constituents write expressing concern vaccine programme, particular, injuries scheme.
agree wrong media, indeed colleagues, castigate campaigners vaccine- injured conspiracy theorists, anti- vaxxers troublemakers?.
friend says, people took vaccine response call government, deserve support health service government turn injured.
grateful.
friend generous comments.
valuable member- party parliamentary group covid- 19 vaccine damage, right say many people—not constituents country, people elsewhere—feel ignored powers.
glimmer hope, public inquiry covid- 19, lady hallett, discussing terms reference called fourth module inquiry—which take place next july—seemed much minded deal issues.
friend mentioned continue concerned.
order emphasise subject, let mention book published recently.
declare interest, one contributors.
“canary covid world: propaganda censorship changed() world” described “a collection essays 34 contemporary thought leaders.
essay, said great deal issues, including failure vaccine damage payment scheme recognise people suffered harm, cases, bereavement result vaccines.
could, said, continue ignore pressures.
encouraging learn happening parts world contributors canada,, rest europe, australia new zealand.
house commons library edition book, going return library, members want look,.
commend.
friend sterling work done behalf people injured vaccine.
may return point covid inquiry baroness hallett said?
would want give impression means government able leave inquiry deal issue, given may produce full report many years.
people need compensation.. friend agree government adopt proposal—which provides much shorter timescale—and get, rather using inquiry get jail card?
absolutely.. friend anticipated going say later, namely government need take head sand face reality issue debated inquiry next year.
people rights audience already made preliminary statements.
would much better government undertake action set bill, rather waiting inevitable next summer?
sense, government found: everybody realises, contrary impression given long time, people—an unfortunate minority—the covid vaccines bad news.
cases, resulted deaths bereavements.
failure face heart concern led producing bill.
grateful.
friend sponsoring.
unlike many bills introduced place, bill explanatory notes, people look see asking reasonable.
need legislation; needs part government act things set explanatory notes..
friend said, issue go away, much agenda.
meantime, thousands people put claims, claims dealt pitifully slowly.
half assessed.
latest statistics got—it quite difficult drill government parliamentary questions—say, 19 september, 221 claims would successful basis causation fell short meet 60% disability threshold, 142 claims awarded exceed 60% threshold.
363 cases accepted disabilities suffered direct consequence vaccine.
interesting 221 claims fell 60% disability threshold, 116 would exceeded 20% threshold?
show government unreasonable sticking 60% disability threshold, rather reducing threshold way suggest bill?
response parliamentary question 199355, received 19 september, told: “from october 2021 september 2023 …6, 809 claims relating covid- 19 vaccinations” made scheme, “and 251 claims relating vaccines illnesses”, including 15 measles, mumps rubella.
think reasonable people would say alarm bells ringing strongly, almost claims vaccine damage payment scheme received last two years relation covid- 19 vaccines.
hardly relation mmr—15,, 809—and failing deal adequately, 809 claims actually undermining case vaccine confidence.
consequence, seeing lower take- vaccines.
people trust vaccines trust government, lack trust centred around way government responded—or failed respond—to vaccine damage resulted covid- 19 vaccines.
serious issue.
serious issue.
hope minister rather forthcoming response predecessors past.
really got beyond point government accepting people died suffered serious injury result vaccines.
sure.
friend come point, want steal thunder.
however, authorities accepting people damaged.
would making payments unless accepted damage actually taken place.
nevertheless, cases compensation given cover costs dealing disabilities people consequence.
given government coerced people taking covid- 19 vaccine, without particularly warning adverse reactions might happen cases,.
friend think cost dealing disabilities caused covered government full, rather arbitrary limit place?
absolutely.
essence, bill calls.
moment, someone put claim resolved months years later.
even found suffered serious injuries, maximum payment £120, 000, meant cover consequential losses, cost care perhaps lifetime support may need result injuries.
government say, “don’t worry, bring civil claim parallel, civil claims people bringing parallel frustrated government lawyers.
cases, months gone department health social care said, “you making claim astrazeneca rather department.
however, essentially claim organisation, government indemnifier liabilities part producers these—at time—experimental vaccines.
quote briefly reply prime minister gave right.
learned friend member kenilworth southam( jeremy wright) 22 march year.
right.
learned friend constituent litigant; suffered four weeks coma permanent injuries result.
carers, associated costs loss earnings, £120, 000 begin get near compensation would entitled normal circumstances.
right.
learned friend asked prime minister £120, 000 maximum payment arbitrary 60% threshold, prime minister respond either point?
sadly,.
said: “we taking steps reform vaccine damage payment schemes, modernising operations providing timely outcomes”.
[ official report, 22 march 2023; vol. 730,.
330.]
answer.
hardly accurate either, outcomes timely.
many people waiting 18 months application dealt.
many hundreds applications medical notes still received.
government, pressure, said would introduce subject access requests ensure people could get medical notes.
subject access requests put forward, respect every case.
lot requests outstanding three months, statutory limit one month.
think prime minister correct saying effective steps taken modernise operations provide timely outcomes.
turn briefly bill, particularly link covid- 19 inquiry.
13 september year, lady hallett held preliminary hearing module inquiry,, said, take place july next year.
issue adequacy vaccine damage payment scheme fully agenda meeting july.
hearing, heard legal representatives groups people suffered vaccine damage.
morris counsel.
said: “the primary causes injuries deaths: vaccine- induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, vitt; vaccine induced vasculitis; stoke; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; guillain- barré syndrome.
survivors cope aftereffects injuries, including brain damage physical disablement, whilst bereaved struggling live without partners, children parents.
vibuk members confirmation injuries caused covid- 19 vaccine.
issue debated inquiry next year.
morris kc goes say: “in addition injury bereavement, represent also experienced second trauma: lack medical knowledge understanding risk presentation vaccine injury left injured people undiagnosed without treatment.
furthermore, prevailing institutional mindset within medical bodies government fixated solely acknowledging benefits vaccine.
led reporting vaccine injury feel disbelieved, unheard marginalised.
goes: “censorship real issue, lady vaccine injured bereaved.
support groups shut social media platforms experiences censored mainstream media.
speak code online fear source support taken away.
face stigma abuse sharing symptoms context covid vaccine even branded anti-
vax sharing real medically proven vaccine injuries.
says: “in august last year cv family lost first member suicide survey members reported 73% considered suicide.
issues going debated covid inquiry.
government something actively?.
friend, ever, making powerful case.
indication whether covid inquiry—or even bill; entirely clear reading, although perhaps correct me—any changes made retrospectively, cases already considered, either disability threshold maximum compensation, would revisited event changes made?.
friend makes good point.
view changes retrospective relation whose claims already dealt.
relatively small number people respect causation established disability threshold 60% met could dealt routine way.
also bigger issue whether £120, 000 payment, increased since 2007, updated line inflation.
raised minister past, said looking taking account points made.
blatant abuse.
2007 government thought £120, 000 reasonable payout, think significantly lower sum real terms appropriate?
government cause rampant inflation, one main beneficiaries, refusing index tax allowances line inflation.
government' coffers filling result inflationary pressures, yet continue scrooge- like relation people right thing got vaccinated interests public health suffered consequences adverse reaction.
good enough.
government listen?
hope happen result debate pressure government must feeling happen covid inquiry.
points made submissions covid inquiry, important lady hallett counsel inquiry made quite clear spending lot time looking particular issues.
longer government able avoid answering questions, able house raise questions give non- answers.
facing cross- examination counsel inquiry held account actions lack action., although bill obviously get second reading, government need take account act recommendations, issue going go away.
conscious members want speak debate, make couple points.
government prepared increase rate people paid, going get anywhere?
moment, people sadly victims contaminated blood scandal show 60% disability order qualify compensation.
equivalence compensation payable contaminated blood inquiry paid become victims covid- 19 vaccines?
look personal injury payouts judicial college guidelines, 60% disability equivalent- knee amputation one leg.
guidelines, would give rise damages—just trauma—of anything £105, 000 £137, 000. consequential loss flowing that—the loss earnings, health costs rest it—would addition.
show paltry sums?
makes case- fault system.
messing around trying establish liability?
somebody confirmed perfectly healthy vaccine suffers lot adverse consequences, accept, absence explanation, must assumed consequences direct result vaccine?
interestingly, oxford university' centre socio- legal studies described vaccine damage payments act 1979 “no- fault compensation scheme”.
would., would.
one important issues addressed government.
indeed, addressed jurisdictions.
let remember years government said vaccines absolutely safe effective—there qualification.
germany' health minister said something similar, recently retracted, saying got wrong although safe effective respects, safe effective everybody.
result, germany paying significant sums people adversely affected.
government need address issue seriously try get back right foot advance hearings covid inquiry next july.
ask house supports bill second reading.
pleasure see chair,.
commend.
friend member christchurch( christopher chope) tremendous speech setting inarguable case, ferocious tenacious way pursued matter.
like dog bone, sure victims damage covid vaccine grateful champion situation.
pointed, sponsor bill support wholeheartedly.
would also like encourage think extending scope bit deals damage caused vaccines, seeks try prevent damage happening first place.
obviously, people severely disabled, cases, died result vaccine, comfort; want prevent happening first place things could usefully done try help regard.
course, authorities love play fact people suffered adverse reactions covid- 19 vaccines.
sure many contact constituents experienced serious symptoms following vaccination.
talking sore arm, many people suffered result vaccination, range life- changing conditions strokes, heart attacks blood clots, name.. friend mentioned anna morris kc submission covid inquiry; said, normal side effects anybody would reasonably expect pharmaceutical product.
much hope, minister responds debate, puts clearly record government accept people suffered adverse reactions covid- 19 vaccine, cases, serious adverse reactions.
cases, people died result taking vaccine.
opportunity today make clear record everybody hear.
anticipate speech regards.
doubt say vaccine programme great success gave vast majority people great deal benefit.
point particular case,.
friend said start speech.
nobody arguing.
talking small proportion people—it large number people—who suffered adverse reactions result covid- 19 vaccine.
hope address directly speech.
point.
friend makes important.
june 2022, answer question whether government accepted people died direct result received covid- 19 vaccine, minister' response mhra published weekly report “covering adverse reactions approve covid-
19 vaccines”, available following link.
quite.. friend right, today gives minister opportunity make unequivocally clear government accept happened.
would big step right direction would least give comfort people felt ignored far long.
authorities course playing adverse reactions people covid vaccines, first, want pay,.
friend set clearly,, secondly, pushed products strongly public first place—or dare say, coerced public taking time.
course coercion house, back july 2021, voted mandate vaccine care workers, resulting tens thousands hard- working carers leaving jobs.
also came within ace mandating vaccine health workers.
think damage would done, potentially 100, 000 workers leaving nhs back.
december 2021, house voted plan, introduced vaccine passports large gatherings, among things.
knew know, vaccine stop infection transmission.
evidence base policy.
impact assessment done policy.
thank goodness ugliness saw house short- lived.
was—and still am—proud one 126 voted mandation.
people coerced ways.
people told allowed go flight anywhere unless taken two vaccines.
allowed visit anywhere.
effect, everything done force people take vaccine.
whether, utilitarian terms, good bad thing neither regard.
friend' bill., given, people adverse reactions covid vaccination —in cases, serious ones; cases, sadly, people died—the government absolute duty pay appropriate compensation people moved heaven earth force take first place.
cases, forced people take will— otherwise, would lost jobs.
government duty something.
moment good enough.
worth noting shocking treatment unvaccinated people became.
policies led untold damage livelihoods mental health.
friends family turned backs, prevailing narrative politics media must bad people making mind personal medical intervention.
think.
friend member broxbourne( walker), one greatest people house, summed best: “suggesting people, whatever reason... chosen get vaccinated somehow deserving bile disgrace.
reflect badly; reflects badly. ”

76- 77.]
black white pfizer website, one read important safety information concerning pfizer/ biontech covid- 19 vaccine: “myocarditis pericarditis occurred people received” product, “most commonly…adolescent males 12 17 years age.
goes say chance occurring “very low”—i sure minister reiterate today—but, course, chance somebody age suffering serious illness related covid low well.
minister might keen point, pfizer seem point website, make clear,.
raise because—i hope minister address remarks—i rather alarmed hear clinical trial moderna mrna covid vaccine involving healthy children aged 12.
something past, pandemic; happening.
approved medicines healthcare products regulatory agency involves bradford patient recruitment centre, edge constituency, constituents could involved.
wrote health research authority august ask ethical rationale inclusion healthy children trial, known, long time, healthy children vanishingly low risk covid- 19—they height pandemic certainly.
far, received coherent answer simple question.
come attention centre recruiting children trial using advertisements ethically approved, required law.
children recruited clinical trial individuals reasonable expectation significant benefit balanced risks associated participation.
potential benefits adults may flow trial good enough rationale trump principle., given cannot expectation significant benefits cohort people significant risk, going?
decisions made? comes back started: authorities seem completely unable, cases unwilling, protect people—in case, children—from potential harm.
cost-
benefit analysis, done—i sure has—certainly appear stack.
finish commending recommendations.
friend member christchurch bill.
government duty care people injured lost loved ones vaccine, took government pressured.
government also duty prevent harm happening first place.
failing act lead harm damage public' trust authority.
hope minister, summing, refer happening bradford explain particular trial allowed go ahead.
pandemic, authorities go big warning people potential damage adverse effects vaccine; interested coercing many people possible taking.
must accept responsibility done right thing faced damage result.
hope government put right today.
,, thank.
friend member christchurch( christopher chope) introducing bill, work research gone, reaching speaking people.
tail end speech, talked phrase “safe effective”, start speech.
“safe effective” became covid vaccine catchphrase—we call that—and repeated many times couple years.
cropped everywhere: government communications, interviews experts across media happy run covid slogan—safe effective.
ingrained become national psyche ever ask questions covid vaccine became difficult indeed.
asking questions vital part scientific political debate.
however, discussing covid, longer appeared dealing science—oh,, speaker—rather, dealing “the science”.
question “the science” risk called labelled “covidiot”, poisonous terms “anti- vaxxer”.
people wanted query new vaccine closed vilified.
looked definition “anti- vaxxer” surprised learn someone opposes use vaccines, regulations mandating vaccination, usually.
246 house, 13 july 2021, voted mandating vaccines care workers.
246 anti- vaxxers house, according latest definition.
absolute nonsense.
people anti- vaxxers.
people concerned families losing faith vaccines way treated covid- 19 vaccine.
drops take- mmr polio vaccines, wrong; people need take vaccines.
members house wanted question new vaccine, debate, particularly house wanted mandate people care workers.
point: allow language corrupted way, definitions words bent shape, lack tools nuanced debate.
wide open debate get central gravity truth.
anything like wide open debate topic safety efficacy covid- 19 vaccines.
come back word “safe”, means free harm risk kind.
word absolute definition.
qualified diminished, yet know, like medical interventions, covid- 19 vaccines 100% free risk danger.
blue guide, document published mhra gives detailed guidance legislation controlling medicines advertised, says: “advertising implies product
‘safe’ unacceptable. medicines potential side- effects medicine completely risk free individual patients respond differently treatment.
principle replicated pharmaceutical industry' self- regulatory code practice, also word “safe” must used without qualification.
basis, worryingly, pfizer astrazeneca guilty industry' self- regulatory code breaking best practice.
found misled public misrepresenting overstating efficacy covid vaccines erroneously describing “safe” press releases social media without qualification.
many organisations individuals also guilty misleading public way?
told astrazeneca vaccines perfectly “safe”—that word again—and evidence blood clots.
advice changed april 2021 age 30 would offered alternative brand, due proven link blood clots.
advice changed- 40s would offered alternative brand.
safety signal picked acted on—thank goodness—but denmark problem picked much sooner.
paused use astrazeneca vaccine 11 march 2021, vaccinated 734, 000 people.
time, 24 million people vaccinated, without mhra detecting signal problem.
far behind curve?
debate closed people allowed even question going?
mrna vaccines?
florida last year, state surgeon general recommended males aged 18 39 receiving mrna covid- 19 vaccines brand.
question: evidence florida reacting, mhra urgently looking whether following suit?
july 2020, government published “first harm” report, highlighted significant problems.
stated: “the mhra needs substantial revision, particularly relation adverse event reporting medical device regulation.
needs ensure engages patients outcomes.
also stated: “the spontaneous reporting platform medicines devices, yellow card system, needs reform”, “system good enough spotting trends practice outcomes give rise safety concerns.
done since report published two years ago?
concerns heard acted?
dame june raine, head mhra, recently said covid pandemic “has catalysed transformation regulator watchdog enabler”, exactly sound like good news anyone concerned safety.
ultimately comes: government repeatedly told public covid vaccines safe, many—probably vast majority—they, plenty people suffered result decision follow government advice take new medical intervention.
tragically lost lives, noted last month covid inquiry anna morris kc, victims families marginalised “face stigma abuse sharing symptoms…and even branded anti- vax sharing real medically proven vaccine injuries.
really quite unacceptable.
way past time government right thing follow recommendations.
friend member christchurch.
shocking hear slowly vaccine damage payment scheme operating.
applicants wait months.
heard solicitor peter todd recent hearing- party parliamentary group pandemic response recovery.
described 139 applicants waiting 18 months decision case.
excessively long, especially people injured potentially unable work.
also told 162 claims found disablement caused vaccine, judged people disabled enough merit financial reward.
many cases, decision reached without meeting even speaking applicant help assessment.
rare cases money awarded, payment changed since 2007,.
friend said, value eroded inflation, simply good enough.
conclusion, make plea transparency integrity.
time honest public safety vaccines, must start giving access information data without delay.
must also, urgent priority, look damaged, tragically lost loved ones.
may begin restore faith undoubtedly lost authorities responsible protecting promoting public health.
many unanswered questions repetition ministers three words—“safe effective”—is simply good enough answer, reasons given, delighted support bill introduced.
friend member christchurch.
congratulate.
member christchurch( christopher chope) securing second reading bill.
thank right.
member tatton( esther mcvey).
member shipley( philip davies) participating debate.
listened attentively issues raise.
begin setting labour' position matter.
believe covid-
19 vaccine safe effective.
saved countless lives, across globe.
course pandemic, 230, 000 people across died covid- 19.
therefore, important understate getting vaccination, continues, single effective way reduce deaths severe illness covid-
19.
rose— members across house aware vaccines go extensive ongoing testing procedures.
covid-
19 vaccines went multiple stages clinical trials approved.[ interruption.]
vaccine met strict independent standards safety, quality effectiveness.
point,.
lady give way?.
order.
entirely. lady whether gives way, members walk chamber three quarters way debate seek intervene.
important set labour' position matter.
without vaccine work scientists, volunteers nhs staff, would able end lockdowns return daily lives.
sure agree.
therefore, shadow health social care team remain extraordinarily grateful worked hard build roll vaccines across.
however, covid-
19 vaccination programme hugely successful, extremely rare cases people sadly suffering side effects deteriorating health possible links covid- 19 vaccines.
serious adverse events rare compared number doses administered, occur, unexpected life- changing implications.
therefore right healthcare system government improve diagnosis treatment suffered.
yellow card scheme already collects monitors information suspected safety concerns, dedicated team scientists reviews information monitor vaccine roll.
encourage everyone keep using scheme, ensure information collected.
vaccine damage tragically occurs, right individuals families access vaccine damage payment scheme.
important scheme fit purpose government act make happen.
reports operational delays within vaccine damage payment scheme.
reports suggests hundreds people waiting 12 months outcome, waiting 18 months.
fact, following question vdps earlier year, prime minister vowed improve scheme, interested hear minister government' response tackling delays.
minister confirm government believe scheme fit purpose whether plan update?
government assure nhs business services authority capacity process applications vdps timely manner?
urge ministers meet engage affected individuals families look ways improve diagnosis treatment claims vdps addressed quickly.
point,.
lady give way?,.
member spoken length already.
grateful.
lady giving way.
labour party believe vaccine damage payment scheme fit purpose, believe?
said, asked minister meet members families directly affected see whether ways improve scheme, could addressed quickly.
best step forward, need listen individuals regarding tailored support needs improved.
finally, would remiss join colleagues calling scourge vaccine misinformation.
getting vaccine important, especially vulnerable. must ensure vaccine misinformation debunked, important message, vaccine safe effective, shared.
hope minister echo remarks danger misinformation.
getting vaccination important health nation—indeed, world—to playing fast loose facts.
although opposition support bill, hope government tackle issues.
members raised, address whether action required.
congratulate.
friend member christchurch( christopher chope) securing second reading bill.
important issue, thank tone conducted debate sentiments start, said anti- vaccination.
right.
friend member tatton( esther mcvey) indicated, vaccination crucial part armour dealing disease across world.
bill specifically covid vaccination advocate, shadow minister, clean water, vaccinations effective public health intervention world terms saving lives promoting good health.
flu vaccination, rolled speak, enable many people healthy winter avoid hospital admission.
hpv vaccination preventing cervical cancer, rolled young girls boys schools, potential eradicate cervical cancer future, must remember vaccination powerful role play health nation.
globally, one best immunisation programmes around world, important pay tribute staff take part vaccinations programmes make success.
let turn covid vaccination.
forefront tackling covid-
19 vaccination programme, first healthcare system world deliver covid vaccination outside clinical trials.
proud. shadow minister said, one reason one first countries lift restrictions, success covid vaccination.
point made.
friend member shipley( philip davies), happy go record say although covid vaccines saved tens thousands lives, unfortunately extremely rare circumstance individuals, sadly, experienced harm difficult circumstances, following covid vaccination.
thankfully, cases remain rare, reduce impact individuals experienced families.
sure whole house join expressing concern individuals suffered harm, families.
vaccination remains best way individuals protect others impact covid- 19.
done right thing encouraging people vaccine, protect vulnerable members society.
grateful minister said, think people, acknowledges, suffered harm damage vaccine—they coerced taking one form another—would probably prefer sympathy concern people house.
really want proper compensation.
therefore take board.
friend member christchurch( christopher chope) said ensure people adequately properly compensated damage done?
least ensure maximum amount paid rises line inflation?
come points shortly.
medicines risks side effects—even simple paracetamol, taken safely vast majority people, serious side effects some—and different covid vaccine.
true vaccinations, set scheme specifically vaccinations first place.
government cannot support bill' proposals make provision financial assistance specifically covid vaccination.
scheme whole support anyone side effects certain level impairment vaccination, would wrong single covid- 19 separate scheme.
government already provide long- standing mechanisms offer financial assistance individuals suffering disablement following vaccination form vdps.
clarify, vdps compensation scheme.
established 1979 provide one- tax- free payment individuals found balance probability harmed vaccine listed vaccine damage payments act 1979.
december 2020, covid- 19 added scheme ensure severe disability found linked covid- 19 vaccine would receive support tried tested system.
government' current focus scaling scheme' operation nhs business services authority, took running november 2021 department work pensions, felt better placed access patient notes improve timeliness.
seen significant improvement trying process claims, come.
bill also asks government report
merits- fault compensation scheme covid- 19 vaccine damage.
establishing dedicated stand- alone scheme would risk favouring, extremely rare circumstances, sadly experienced harm following covid- 19 vaccine harmed vaccines,,, happen rare circumstances.
would create inequality vaccines, could damaging vaccination programmes.
another element bill question whether upper limit financial assistance available.
important reiterate vdps offers one- lump sum payment.
intended cover lifetime costs impacted.
amount revised periodically statutory sums orders.
initial payment scheme set 1978 £10, 000. reviewed several times, current amount set £120, 000 july 2007.
award considered addition government' support package disability long- term health condition, includes statutory sick pay, universal credit, employment support allowance, attendance allowance personal independence payments.
minister says figure reviewed periodically £120, 000. said last reviewed 2007, 16.
years ago.
think time another periodic review?
