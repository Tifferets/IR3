million, million patients month waiting four weeks gp appointment —if could get one all—the junior doctors still dispute strike, dental deserts across huge parts country, people cannot get nhs dentist love money.
government honest scale crisis serious fixing, means need best available advice—it hands deck fix mess previous government left.
single patient waited longer treatment needed failed ask expert advice around, would consider betrayal patients' interests.
decide hear meetings, decide whose advice seek, decide share.
also welcome challenge, alternative perspectives experience.
right honourable alan milburn former member house, member privy council former health secretary.
pass department, every departmental meeting attended, present request ministers.
alan' time office, gave patients choice treated treats, well making sure nhs properly transparent, patients able make informed choice—a basic right expect walks life, wealthy well connected able exercise healthcare alan changed.

made tough reforms drove better performance across nhs, along every labour health secretary, delivered shortest waiting times highest patient satisfaction history nhs.
record labour' record, kind experience want around table write reform agenda lift nhs worst crisis history, get back feet, make fit future.
fear right.

reorganisation created, although alan sensibly turned labelled reorganisation “the biggest car crash” history nhs, goes prove alan milburn sound judgment worth listening.
right.
