short, inadequate simply rise challenges face country.
fundamentally government ideas.
stuck high- tax, low- growth economy, abandoned promises many areas failed invest public services, instead engage cheap, divisive politics.
contrast clear, mission- led agenda set leader opposition, would heart future labour government.
always talking points ministers dispatch box, heard barracking today conservative back benchers, fed cheap shots talking wales regularly hear government benches.
stark contrast seen tory government level seen labour- led government wales, indeed labour- led councils cardiff vale glamorgan.

need adequate fit--- future services across cardiff penarth.
course come adequate investment across co- operative relationship government—hopefully labour government—and welsh labour government, along welsh labour councils wales.

lot problems predate devolution.
leasehold system decades decades old—i think hundreds years old.

acknowledge members debate, think, parties house parts.
government abandoned lgbt+ action plan disbanded lgbt+ advisory board.
told home office minister hysterical raising concerns significant rises hate crime faced lgbt+ community.

house must commit whatever keep alive light peace, welcome clear commitment speech supporting two- state solution.
return conservatives' plan, biggest question think anywhere near good enough.
chaos unleashed—after levelling, “no rules broken, “we’re together, broken promises last 13 years—this plan put working people country say, “trust, we’ve changed.'
laughable.
cannot see: possible conclusion.
walls place high.
let assure house sees, sees today offer change public services, change cost living crisis, change economic model failed give working people security opportunity deserve.
change needs, today missed opportunity.
needed king' speech would draw line 13 years tory decline—a king' speech national renewal serious plan growth.
instead, party devoid leadership happy follow home secretary describes homelessness “lifestyle choice” believes job protecting extremists—the basic job government—is legitimate terrain divisive brand politics.
director public prosecutions, worked closely police counter- terrorism forces.
job hard enough already without home secretary using platform ambitions.
say prime minister: think carefully committing government, think carefully consequences putting greater demands public servants coalface keeping safe—because without serious home secretary, serious government, cannot serious prime minister.
homelessness choice—it political choice.

opposition benches, plan build.
million homes across country, reformed planning regime unlock potential, can’t fix homelessness without increasing supply housing, can’t boost growth unless workers homes need, can’t escape cost living crisis unless affordable housing.
know prime minister finds position, prepared stand blockers, shows radically improve supply housing bringing back national housing targets, yes, count labour votes, country needs: credible plan growth; growth comes grassroots growth serves grassroots, higher living standards every community—an ambition delivered roll sleeves get building.
moment, get tunnel built country require planning application 30 times longer complete works shakespeare.
today needed planning bill strip red tape get building.
also needed bold commitment train next generation, new technical colleges, apprenticeship levy reform expert teachers every classroom, giving british businesses skills need.
needed modern industrial strategy statutory footing, bill match—a signal intent world serious fighting jobs future.
needed employment bill.
time, bill promised; time, fails materialise, could scrapping fire rehire, ending zero- hours contracts, making work pay real living wage saying unambiguously strong workers' rights good growth.
got instead exercise economic miserabilism: admission government faith' ability avert decline.
take oil gas bill announced today—a bill everyone energy sector knows political gimmick even energy secretary admits take single penny anyone' bills.
know seven bins prime minister chucked meat tax, one follow soon.
none less, gimmick tells story: king' speech concern national interest, wallowing pessimism says hard road better future isn’t.
way 13 years: failure seize opportunities, perhaps even see opportunities; working people hit conservatives build gas storage, invest clean british energy, scrapped home insulation.:
moving targets back, passing next generation, even costs rise rise.

government wrong clean energy—it cheaper, british give real security tyrants like putin.
importantly, wrong.
win race jobs tomorrow; work hand glove private sector invest critical infrastructure—the gigafactories, new ports clean british steel light fire renewal british industrial communities.
today day could struck match light, embraced new sense mission tackled cost living crisis new plan growth.
chance get building again—take back streets, get nhs back feet, deliver cheaper bills real energy security, tear barriers opportunity—but 14th year row, government passed, severed relationship' future gave national interest.
speech shows ever greater clarity fight left government fight skin—a government given, dragging, ever steadily towards decline; day became crystal clear change needs tory decline labour renewal.
