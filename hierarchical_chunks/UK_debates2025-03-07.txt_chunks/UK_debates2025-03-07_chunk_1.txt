bill also commits government instruct chief medical officer update reissue guidance parents professionals impact excessive screen time social media use children.
nearly six years since guidance last issued, seen positive impact recent guidance elsewhere, surgeon general advice stated recently: “social media proved safe” “children adolescents spend hours day social media face double risk mental health problems including experiencing symptoms depression anxiety.

glasgow—which scotland' second city, stress; even castle—the health board offers guidance dates 2016.
things moved since, surely parents deserve latest guidance comes considering matter.
thank.
friend making point.
updated advice nations' cmos important cascade health systems guide professionals parents.
finally, bill calls government conduct research develop evidence guidance important future action.
given rapidly devices services developing, vital parents carers given-- date advice harm children might exposed.
done?
technology companies profiteering rewiring childhood incredibly effective casting doubt evidence link screen time negative impacts children.
first time industry fought tide evidence order keep peddling product.
1960s, tobacco industry lobbying hard link smoking cancer.
absence evidence causal link, cast doubt overwhelming correlational evidence available.
end, government acted basis correlational studies using criteria set epidemiologist austin bradford hill.
criteria attempt help policymakers make decisions causal studies exist.
criteria included “consistent findings observed different persons different places different samples strengthens likelihood effect.
example, fact students across western world began reporting feeling increasingly lonely school 2012 important.
another criterion “greater exposure generally lead greater incidence effect”— essentially, dose- response effect.
studies multiple large datasets, including' millennium cohort study, show teenagers heavy users social media likely suffer depression, anxiety, eating disorders, body dysmorphia mental health harms.
could take years evidence causal link, scientific studies, established.
meantime, children' mental physical health degrades, education continues affected, evidence correlation gets stronger stronger.
lawmakers, must use tools bradford hill tests make best possible decisions know.
must act excessive screen time today, way acted smoking back.
like debates smoking car seatbelts, took process legislation, rather one big- bang event.
starting initial steps today, following major action soon, important.
let address head- arguments made taking action curb social media smartphone use children.
see five common arguments action.
first enough evidence act.
past months, others number evidence sessions engagements experts shown plainly untrue.
even, burden evidence sit?
sit parents campaigners noticed damage done children, children calling support, companies selling products services designed addictive completely transformed nature childhood?
comes protecting children harm, precautionary approach surely advised.
almost product, companies would prove safe selling children, rather free sell product wish, evidence harm becomes overwhelming something needs done.
instructive surgeon general advice social media yet “been proved safe.
second argument simply latest line moral panics.
people used fear watching much television would turn eyes square; victorian era, reading novels would degrade intellect; 20th century, playing violent videogames would turn children thugs.
every example overblown moral panic, many examples genuine public health crises took long address, eventually forced tackle.
research come morning common demonstrates issue luddite older generations bemoaning shifting social trends.
concerns social media smartphone use dominant every generation, half generation regret amount time spending social media.
third argument hear genie bottle, late anything.
phones social media undoubtedly stay, harms need.
regulation find way allowing children experience benefits technology, without exposed, relentlessly, harms.
introducing seatbelt laws saved thousands lives road traffic accidents without killing car industry, introducing virtual seatbelt protect children excessive screentime.
action countries, experience online safety act 2023, early though, shown tech companies beyond power governments.
fourth argument, tends come big tech, proper age verification difficult, age restriction unproven—that technology exist imperfect.
companies yoti many age verification platforms show, longer case.
also technology optimist.
reason technology yet pervasive insufficient demand.
introduce regulation, technology catch up—we see australia later year.
suggestions government' job get involved issue parental responsibility.
misses point collective action problem.
parents children alone able establish new, shared rules something addictive societal level.
reason smartphones social media causing much stress conflict families giving parents unenviable choice either removing devices ostracising children giving demands access living health, sleep learning consequences.
additionally, parental controls device, operating system app level confusing opaque, existing data laws give children young 13 power data means opt parental controls year secondary school.
disempower parents problem common across society, ask help, say matter personal responsibility.
hope today' debate bury argument responsibility problem lies parents struggling impossible challenge.
thought.
friend might like know making arguments arguing argue.
welcome minister' intervention, glad boxed five.
moments politics falls behind public mood.
process traditions democratic system make difficult keep rapidly evolving world tech social media, works best reflection problems concerns people chamber earnest problem solving action.
last months, encouraged sheer volume support bill debate, comes across country, across ages across house.
firm belief unless politicians able disruptors issue solve, left disrupted.
acting assertively together sooner bring benefits tech industry public services, quality family life, importantly, opportunities children.
reasons, commend bill house.. member whitehaven workington( josh macalister), far beautiful north- west, made extremely strong case original bill envisaged bringing house.
afraid today speak celebrate progress, lament gutting could landmark bill.
sadly, government, like last—notwithstanding online safety act 2023—have dithered, diluted capitulated, afraid remains hollowed- gesture opportunity missed.. gentleman said, evidence strong, damage profound public support overwhelming.
documentary documentary details significant damage done young people daily basis.
parent parent millions homes across land screaming help assistance government..
gentleman rightly pointed, allowing smoking brain youngest children, long- term impact.
afraid say face overwhelming evidence momentum,.
gentleman done bringing forward bill.
look presented, said, nothing gesture.
first point cmo bring forward guidance.. gentleman surely knows, already plenty guidance parents—the nspcc online guidance, internet matters.
lots organisations, including schools, issuing guidance parents.
truth, cmo producing guidance within 12 months effective organisations, possibly less.. gentleman pointed, dealing collective action issue.
organisation issue guidance, small percentage parents may pick guidance observe, percentage 20%, strong peer pressure addictive dealing parents end screaming matches teenage children daily basis.
explaining many fragmented and—no doubt—contradictory sources information, surely right.
gentleman making argument single source advice parents right across?
surely bill create authoritative set guidance parents share children.
convinced guidance created bill authoritative created nspcc internet matters.
point making necessarily guidance going pivotal, need get critical mass observance guidance likely impact.
original bill likely, least ban schools, created nucleus clear space children could translated homes.
many members may heard bbc morning short piece fulham boys school, absolute ban even bringing smartphone school.
ban school period resulted periods school also phone- free, therefore much social beneficial pupils.
urge right.
gentleman slightly less sceptical value cmo advice.
knows, campaigned many years acquired brain injury, particularly relation concussion sub- concussive events sport.
significant change, previous administration, british government brought forward specific advice relation concussion sport.
changed practices lots sports around country, hopeful authoritative advice kind could make significant difference.
would willing accept.
gentleman' encouragement advice schools,; advice parents carers.
going authoritative advice schools, well organisations charge children—scout troops, children' clubs, publicly funded organisations look children—i would said, “possibly, even though 12- month delay cmo tells stuff already know,.
member whitehaven workington pointed.
second step government publish plan research within 12 months.
conclusion research, time limit—just plan, vague aspiration plan, commencement, sense budget idea might come.
sorry say.
member whitehaven workington sold cosmetic pup.
third final point government publish “assessment”—whatever may be—which, far see, fundamentally tell something already know,.
gentleman illustrated extremely vividly.
furious delay prevarication injected could huge step forward parents children.
one people angry, right.
friend co- sponsor bill, disappointment must even greater.
however, agree one way forward would bill, present inadequate drafting, get second reading go committee?
people' representatives committee would able restore bill something closer expected.
going come later,.
friend completely right.
support much right.
gentleman saying need urgent action.
conversations july last year tightening legislation around smartphones, problem start day general election, party government? said start speech, lament dithering delay previous government,.
attempts back benchers—and one last two years government—to change online safety bill take exactly sort measures.
rebuffed ministers stage, regret completely., national, international, emergency, far passive complacent.
necessarily making political point; weight government, frankly, weight influence big tech health welfare children.
applies governments stripes countries across world.
chamber furious.
plenty people country furious, two key things promised original bill.
first absolute school ban.
members know go visit schools, one features coming strongly talk headteachers increase parental aggression towards schools.
source conflict school gate around sorts issues, least use phones schools.
advocating complete blanket ban phones schools, would removing one stroke source conflict parent teacher, well time creating completely clear space kids concentrate education.
school upon school across country, bringing policies, often teeth opposition, whether parental children.
life made immeasurably difficult absolute ban.
second thing promised second reason furious raising digital age consent.
including bill, consenting tech companies—as admitted meetings run- bill—using children' data addict services.
know happens, see happening.
anybody teenage child tried desperately move cradling precious phone dinner table even watching tv time see cannot get away phone realise addictive nature.
fact neither two steps bill, afraid, deeply lamentable. feels though government capitulated big tech.
look online see—i casting aspersions—but would helpful minister could tell remarks meetings big tech companies run- bill, whether consulted spoken.
[ interruption.]
minister indicating zero, useful know, cannot understand government pressured new member whitehaven workington produce, frankly, cosmetic pup, betraying children capitulating big tech.
afraid bill shell could, result yet another missed opportunity improve lives young people.
start paying tribute.
friend member whitehaven workington( josh macalister) introducing bill work advance debate need action halt harms caused mobile phones screen time children young people.
less year ago, previous, education committee published report impact screen time education wellbeing.
based careful examination evidence, committee concluded “the harms screen time social media use significantly outweigh benefits young children, whereas limited use screens genuinely educational uses digital technology benefits older children.
worth restating evidence committee looked.
saw 52% increase children' screen time 2020 2022, continued rise since time.
twenty-
five per cent children young people use phones way consistent behavioural addiction—a staggering statistic.
one five children aged three four mobile phone.
one four children phone age eight, almost 12- year- olds mobile phone.
rapid change behaviour, happened without corresponding policy regulatory framework.
substantial evidence negative effects rapid increase use smartphones children.
research children' commissioner found 79% children encountered violent pornography online age 18.
girls young women particularly affected pressure conform unrealistic body images see social media.

impacts learning home classroom,.
take 20 minutes pupils refocus learning engaging non- academic activity phone.
children worse working memory, processing speeds, attention levels, language skills executive function.
sheer amount time spent looking screens also contributing children becoming sedentary less active.
harms affecting children, greatest vulnerability suffer.
children care, care leavers, young carers, children living poverty children additional needs susceptible online harms.
vulnerable children also risk criminal exploitation using screens.
social media online gaming described leading work tackle county lines exploitation foundation county lines recruitment.

every generation parents help children navigate set challenges face.
screen time social media surely parenting challenges generation.

issue uniting families way, hope.
lady, chairs education committee, push government, behalf parents children, change outcome.
education committee certainly continue take issue extremely seriously monitor happens, say little moment.
know screen time quite literally rewiring young brains, resulting lower cognitive abilities affecting language acquisition, critical thinking, social skills attention span.
government evidence harm, duty act.
point legislation case power change societal norms way make difference parents professionals currently struggling limit harms screen time, lack back-.
many comparable examples, smoking seatbelts obvious, evidence harm became clear debate raged many years, counter- arguments legislation.. lady says,.
member whitehaven workington( josh macalister) done enormous amount work, obviously desirable government act face evidence.
think bill, negotiated government, constitutes action?
thank right.
gentleman helping difficult moment.
found correct place speech, tell believe happen next.
debate smoking seatbelts raged years, much controversy time.
demanding higher higher levels proof, others argued matter could dealt simply guidance individuals' choosing change behaviour.. lady recognise, unlike indoor smoking ban particular, regulation mobile technology social media much one- event?
bill become online safety act published, genuinely world- leading many respects,,.
member whitehaven workington( josh macalister) pointed, many countries introduced measures go.
taking action continuing develop, rather introducing series reviews?.
gentleman bear moment, come points think wanted emphasise.
end, cases—seatbelts smoking—legislation effect changing behaviour changing societal norms, cases, decades introduction legislation, hard imagine regulation ever controversial.
last year, select committee recommended action across departments protect children addiction, online harms mental health impacts excessive use smartphones.
supported ban mobile phones schools recommended formal monitoring mechanism ban introduced guidance, potentially leading ban legislation.
recommended guidance parents, found lacking confidence came knowing exactly tackle issue affecting children young people, recommended guidance include—particularly parents babies young children—an emphasis importance face-- face interactions children, guidance impact screen use parents caring young children.
aspect debate enough place.
select committee supported increase 16 age digital consent recommended, among developments, promotion children' class phone used parental contact gps locations, internet access.
share worry expressed many members government acting urgency required face evidence already.
bill deliver, even form presented today, positive interventions make difference, fear government little slowly.
parents want strong legislation, schools want strong legislation, strong legislation help change societal norms way needed protect children young people stop harms.
education committee take close interest happens on—the impact measures government introducing—but urge government get quickly review guidance commit today, go establish, urgency speed, framework law help parents, schools professionals working children deal challenge need get grips.
pleased speak support bill.
must start declaring interest: mother three children enjoy nothing staring screens day, day out—if could, would 24/. longer children clamouring go play see friends; instead, want everything screen.
want watch endless youtube videos.
never realised unpacking toy slime making could hold interest.
seems take joy watching others things online—even, rather bizarrely, playing computer games—instead actually real world.
would hypocrite call behaviour front.,, addicted phone.
yes, need job, justify use, often find endlessly doomscrolling, embarrassed tell house many hours spend staring every week.
least addiction started fully developed adult, childhood play socialisation learned much- needed life skills.
generation children lucky.
huge amount time spent online incredibly damaging many ways.
coincidence see mental health crisis young people time mass adoption smartphones access social media.
may underplay importance social media screens challenges face society, indeed difficult conclusively prove role one particular factor effects seeing, suggest comes children, always err side caution protect potentially harmful influences.
recent survey, social media excessive screen time ranked top issue affecting children' mental wellbeing.
put context, ranked higher alcohol bullying.
another significant risk mental health exposure harmful online content.
incredibly concerned, especially given proliferation extreme pornography, harmful content unrealistic body images.
children spend time fantasy world completely disjointed reality, course change view people, relationships world general.
supported ofcom' 2024 research, showed older teens finding harder distinguish real fake online.
mundane things life trigger dopamine hit seem even less appealing way spend time child jacked likes shares.
children' attention spans getting shorter, ever- increasing need higher levels stimulation.
wonder children seem less interested reading book baking cake nowadays?
evidence health professionals safer screens shows children routinely spend extended periods smartphones poorer eyesight, inhibited speech language development, interrupted sleep, rising rates anxiety.
allowing children become addicts.
social media designed exactly mind.
meant addictive compelling.
wants users stay online prolonged periods keep engaging content.
use know true, earth expect children manage moderate appropriately?
ofcom' 2024 research showed overall use social media sites apps among five seven- year- olds increased year year.
online gaming among group also increased significantly, watching livestreamed content.
current data protection law, age children access information society services—iss—is 13.
iss includes social media platforms content streaming services.
important acknowledge online safety act 2023 introduced protections children ensuring online platforms remove illegal content child sexual abuse material, prevent children accessing harmful content—for example, encouraging suicide, self- harm bullying—and introduce age- checking measures restrict access pornographic material.
welcome improvements, need put place pace effectively enforced.
commend.
member whitehaven workington( josh macalister) work important topic.
support making online world safer children.
bill important precursor myriad changes needed area, know many parents support calling digital age consent looked.
bill call age limit raised 16, call' chief medical officer look important issue detail, ultimately, issue statement whether raised.
75% brits back raising minimum age 13 16, per recent survey common, reasons raised today, 129, 000 people signed- petition calling social media companies banned letting children 16 create social media accounts.
past time tech companies—and members house—to take responsibility keeping children young people safe.
normally favour blanket bans, often talk importance parents carers taking responsibility children.
however, instance, deviate little.
parent wrangling exact issue, know difficult tell child cannot something every single child class.
group friends interacts online, consequences child prohibit joining?
isolation?
loneliness?
loss self- esteem?
real costs underestimated, state needs step.
members often hear say, state needs step remove option, helping parents across country want best children without downsides.. friend vividly illustrates problem kind collective action peer pressure.
reflected fact addictive nature application pulling kids, fact free, therefore everybody encouraged get?
get 100% coverage, hard deny child, child without.
concur everything right.
friend says.
completely accessible children, hard one child kept separate.
important address.
however, increasing digital age consent first step—we much.
also need ban smartphones schools children age 16.
typical workday, 42% older teenagers say smartphone distracting schoolwork, half say social media distracted enough impact grades.
notably, 11% schools genuinely smartphone free, children schools get gcse results one two grades higher, clearly big upside banning smartphones schools.
urge government seriously consider implementing much needed restriction, would game changer, protecting children improving educational outcomes one fell swoop.
schools need ban statute, guidance, order able effectively police enforce.
pay tribute smartphone free childhood work raise awareness important issue.
closing, hope members support bill today, would move forward mission protect children increasingly insidious online realm simply equipped navigate.
also hope beginning, moving forward see digital age consent raised 16 ban smartphones school.
value two changes alone would huge society, would safeguard wellbeing future generations children.
cannot think anything important.
come debate somebody bought first mobile phone 30 years ago, age 23—i hoping members would look surprised.
[ laughter.]
division!
thank minister.
remember clearly joy phoning landline bed asking housemates bring cup tea, excitement sending receiving first text message infantile joy playing snake waiting train.
one could predicted would point.
thank.
friend member whitehaven workington( josh macalister) introducing bill, essential step forward online safety. demonstrates genuine commitment addressing critical issue raises awareness place across country pressing need legally recognised age internet adulthood correspond adult content available online.
long, tech bosses moved forward unchecked children borne consequences algorithms, best, designed create generation screen addicts, worst, expose young people harmful disturbing content.
fifteen years ago, many tech leaders claimed rising mental health crisis among children young people unrelated screen use.
however, emerging data refutes.
study king' college london revealed nearly 25% —one four, still use old money—of children young people engage smartphones manner consistent behavioural addiction.
indeed, dealing passive tech bosses satisfied promoting addictive quality sell platforms children.
even past year, digital landscape shifted much tech bosses actively refusing remove violent material eating disorder content platforms, guise would infringe individuals' free speech.
know, considerable disparity two, strongly support raising age digital adulthood.
issue particularly urgent constituency isle wight west, young people face highest rates- 18 mental health self- harm- related hospital admissions south- east—they also among highest country.
accessing necessary support made even difficult island' isolation.
high cost limited availability ferry travel—hon.
members waiting say that—creates significant barriers, leaving many young people struggling without help need.
already facing pressures increasingly connected world, disadvantaged transport restrictions make seeking specialist care mainland far challenging.
tech companies proved time see kids nothing pound signs.
time platforms keep children glued screens, money make, achieve maliciously harvesting data using push content designed keep hooked, prioritising addictive safest.
prohibiting tech companies collecting data- 16s, bill would aim heart exploitative algorithms designed keep young users online longer.
would ensure children longer targeted addictive content designed prioritise profit wellbeing.
therefore support bill.
congratulate.
