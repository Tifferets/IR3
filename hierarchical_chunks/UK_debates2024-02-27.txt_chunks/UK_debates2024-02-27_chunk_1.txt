december 1998.
mp one year seven months day, chained railings college green 200 cheering leaseholders.
thankfully, friendly.
illustrate leaseholders felt prison.
days social media, photo op.
bbc ran headline, “leaseholders demand control”.
still.
since, commonhold leasehold reform act 2022, attempt resolve problems, forfeiture person' home failure pay small service charge, ground rent grazers charging money service moneys held trust sinking funds.
strange 25 years, areas yet another bill leasehold reform pretending failing solve.
say “failing”, reason rise support new clause, tabled.
friend member greenwich woolwich( matthew pennycook).
ridiculous landlord take away person' home worth hundreds thousands pounds simple failure pay minor service charge amounting couple hundred pounds dispute whether service even provided.
tabled new clause 16 moneys held trust, would implement provision 2002 act never brought force.
heard committee policy strong support stakeholders, including spokespeople property institute leasehold advisory service.
even british property federation campaigned provision 2002 act come force, yet bill.
course, 2002 time nobody even predicted new rentier practices freeholders developers since invented extract money homeowners privilege living homes: scandals leasehold houses; repeated doublings ground rents; inclusion commercial areas shared services development stop hope residents exercising right manage.
new clause 17 would ensure leaseholders mixed- use buildings could take advantage government' policies lift 25% non- residential premises cap 50%, mandatory leasebacks expensive commercial premises.

since right manage- fault regime, never intended invitation litigation deep- pocketed freeholders army lawyers.
loveday notes, 2002 act' right manage “traps unwary”, “the single important problem right manage, namely procedural complexity”, “these problems…famous among property lawyers”, “notoriously led litigation truly industrial scale.
urge minister look new clause 18 place adopt pragmatic amendment, would enable tribunal waive minor procedural mistakes leaseholders deems convenient.
