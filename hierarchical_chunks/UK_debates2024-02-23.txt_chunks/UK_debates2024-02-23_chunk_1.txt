first occasion name drawn private member' bill ballot; pleased say name drawn fourth. thought long hard appropriate best piece draft legislation bring forward.

however, houses clear economic crime corporate transparency act go far enough.
slapps taken take many forms.
vital bring forward legislation genuinely tackles issue holistic rounded sense.
many examples slapps.
refer high- profile cases reached court received publicity, others received much publicity.
begin case sure.
members aware, attracted great deal attention.
2022, defamation case reportedly brought journalist tom burgis, financial times
publishers harpercollins kazakh mining company.
case concerned book burgis entitled “kleptopia: dirty money conquering world”.
defamation case brought roman abramovich journalist catherine belton harpercollins regarding book “putin' people”.
excellent book well worth reading.

familiar case, shadow minister middle east north africa. case concerned memo amersi' background dealings russia.
put together response attempt become chair cmec.
claim amersi struck, failed show memo caused serious harm reputation.
high-
profile cases involve slapps.
case nina cresswell named person violently sexually assaulted original report dismissed police.
commendably wanted alert women may become victims sexual assault.
man named sued defamation.
cresswell landmark judgment last year, fact fight case demonstrates huge gaps slapp claimants ready exploit, need address fact.
also heard stories patients left negative reviews botched plastic surgeries issued slapp claims surgeons.
heard tenants spoken uninhabitable housing issued slapp claims landlords.
wrong must stopped.
given examples relatively high- profile cases, also well known.
many cases attract attention court many know individuals intimidated legal proceedings actually commence.
data government tip iceberg.
suggested, slapps extremely pernicious action reaches court.
pre-
action letters legal pressure applied well proceedings initiated.
often results search investigation withdrawn publication,, cases, whole variety different areas, effectiveness threats intimidation cases never see light day.
accordingly, never reflected available data.
come press country.
let remember, country champions freedoms abroad, must ensure free press, real pillar democracy, never feels vulnerable self- censors vital matters public interest.

gentleman give way?
may respond point made? vital issue considered properly deeply.
hope much, successful today, debate continue committee, consideration may given issue.

member caerphilly( wayne david).
excellent piece legislation broadly support.
wanted respond comment.
member tiverton honiton( richard foord).
subjectivity actually fundamental part legal system already: talk often man clapham omnibus.
reasonableness test, think anything bill scope inappropriate.
inclined agree comment, bill suggests, something needs airing consideration.
detailed consideration committee would appropriate place happen.
others said many times, slapp- related activity takes place radar formal court case court claim issued.
number reasons slapps bad, slapps claimants successful warped objective perpetrating.
commonly, comparatively modest means defendant leveraged encourage retraction abandonment important research would shine light questionable behaviour.
bullying tactics include huge threatened litigation costs damages, unbearable consequences bankruptcy loss homes livelihoods, well emotional distress entails.
cause huge hardship psychological pressure.
sadly, many people able withstand.
many cases like david goliath, david slingshot.
clear unfairness legal system allows challenged changed.
bringing forward bill today.
must eradicate harms caused kind aggressive litigation.
must protect publishers, authors advocates spurious claims empower forge ahead publishing legitimate stories.
grounded, well- researched investigative reporting must protected, reined fear colossal legal costs.
must utmost protect empower ordinary people, give confidence use legal system country ensure fairness public interest.
course, protecting journalists anyone else cannot expense denying claimants rights access justice.
present, fact claimants wrongly exploit justice system obfuscate transparency essential healthy democracy means important balance must struck.
things stand, clearly case, call urgent reform today.
robust action counter slapps forms needed needed.
sought work alongside government ensure approach underpinning economic crime corporate transparency act—which positively received across civil society, media legal professions, including regulators—remains largely intact bill achieves necessary.
bill therefore keep, part, definition slapp claim economic crime corporate transparency act, also broaden scope capture slapps future.
future, slapps cases speaking public interest, including publications economic crime, caught.
let address components definition.
first, claimant acted restrain defendant' exercise right freedom speech.
secondly, exercise right pursuit public interest, exposing potential wrongdoing bad behaviour, illegality untruths, matters public health safety climate environment.
thirdly, claimant misused litigation threat cause harm defendant, specifically harassment, stress expense, beyond ordinarily expected properly conducted litigation.
last point includes important distinction.
legal cases almost always bring measure stress expense parties involved, given serious nature.
said, slapp claims often designed generate excessive stress expense pursuit remedy mere fig leaf, excuse allow real harm claimant wishes cause.
one thing distinguishes slapp claim legal action pursued appropriate remedy, means, right, bringing oppression bear.
safeguard harm effective proportionate way, including ensuring legitimate claims proceed, bill introduce new early dismissal test.
claimants show likely succeed trial.
cannot, case struck.
addition, much harm slapp claims lies risk adverse costs defendants face.
properly functioning early dismissal mechanism assist removing many risks defendant.
however, slapp claims dismissed early, bill introduce new costs regime protects defendants costs would usually pay lost case.
ensure defendants defend properly risk costs force settle claims unnecessarily.
underpinning principles new cost regime included provisions, detail introduced usual cost regime- making powers rules court.
together, provisions initially require new civil procedure rules give shape maximise effectiveness, evidence available shows slapps focused civil proceedings.
however, provisions extended regulations proceedings necessary, online procedure rules.
trust government make necessary regulations claimants well resourced able exploit perceived loophole choose courts pursue slapps.
also help ensure bill future- proofed.
slapps likely evolve, need legal infrastructure robust enough meet future challenges.
result bill, courts necessary tools guidance deal swiftly slapps, aim stifle freedom speech.
investigative journalists also empowered expose wrongdoing forms, whatever may.
hope defendants cases, consequence, feel safe attempts wrongly exploit legal system.
journalists others empowered shine light criminal misconduct wherever find, whatever form takes, without fear spurious claims made.
unscrupulous individuals corporations brazenly misuse courts legal system agendas, detriment public interest, though wrong matter principle.
public must know wrongdoing corruption, democratic society function rule law preserved.
bill recognises breadth depth slapps; currently, law focuses solely economic crime, slapps found areas law.- embracing legislation slapps, believe, truly significant step ensuring freedom speech removing clear abuse legal system.
therefore urge colleagues across house give bill full support.
house proud country' international reputation upholding rule law.
