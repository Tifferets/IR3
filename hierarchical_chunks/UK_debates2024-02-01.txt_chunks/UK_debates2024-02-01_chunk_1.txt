shadow minister makes good points means people pakistan.
impossible say, already pipeline approved applicants, deported.
track, cannot answer specific question, course, alert government pakistan included within review, enjoy protection deportation already approved awaiting onward move.
shadow minister necessarily points politics alleged disagreement among conservative members —that nature role—but simply motivated things.
reality trying best bring many people afghanistan possible.
decisions relatively straightforward, hold employment records, others far complicated.
although undoubtedly decisions robust need reviewed, put record people involved making decisions, across mod, working hardest best.
stand service done, take responsibility shortcomings.
approached people involved training soldiers—333, 444 bost 170—and tell loyal, bravest effective soldiers operating afghanistan.

take time.
call snp spokesperson.
thank shadow minister,.
member plymouth, sutton devonport( luke pollard), securing urgent question.
department' latest numbers show 11, 684 people granted entry,, 377 given indefinite leave.
happened remaining individuals?
still waiting decision?
ejected?
others said, targeted taliban cannot wait.
minister indicated shadow minister discussions pakistan, discussions already taken place?

mod considering cases people claim served alongside armed forces.
although doubt seriousness right asylum, mod makes decisions regard.
responsibility part immigration policy.
turning indefinite leave remain, need write.

assessment minister made number people affected many families?
ministry defence reach families brave men women ensure come, right?
think, 000 decisions need looked.
entirely right decision—they written documented particularly well—so difficult say moment many cases review require scrutiny.
say.
friend carried initial review robustness decisions taken, notify people case review additional information might required.
set detail process “dear colleague” letter follow, expectation also reach point colleague house advocated case, aware review similarly put forward whatever evidence.
grateful minister meeting recently discuss matter, given unique nature relationship forces triples, given commitments made previously, beyond bewildering got point sooner.
minister spoke instances inconsistent application arap criteria certain cases, said takes responsibility, give assurance today work pace put right, think mean international reputation?
people trust future?
grateful constructive engagement.
gentleman department ever since evacuation kabul.
meeting day instructive, much said caused reflect way done.

working pace—the.
gentleman assurance continue, along.
incredibly difficult process consuming ever larger amounts horsepower within department, rightly, owe people debt.
however, come previously defence questions, must careful set expectation among partner forces everywhere armed forces operate, future, immigration angle partnering.
accept reputational damage mod effect reputation, too—that right; ministerial accountability—but push back gently idea impact willingness partner forces work.
think helpful partner forces think reward working visa: work.
appreciate minister' comments commitments today, two years since chaos collapse operation afghanistan surely come much late.
still many people—not triples, interpreters people worked alongside forces—trapped countries hostile threatening transportation back afghanistan.
commit today ensuring, urgency, cases looked quickly speedily, get many people safety possible?
cases looked urgently.
wider arap cohort.
member described, process much easier.
time ago, directed excellent officials work, instead working pile applications, go employment records hold interpreters locally employed civilians, focus finding pile applications rather going applications may spurious less credible.
quickly, takes time, even eligibility decisions taken, people undocumented, many arap cohort, incredibly challenging get afghanistan safe country, limits rate flow enormously.
third countries, excellent staff embassies high commissions facilitate movement countries.
however, countries quite challenging diplomatic relationships, particularly moment, makes particularly difficult.
mean keep trying, grateful ambassadors high commissioners efforts,, fundamentally, cannot tell sovereign countries.
back september, minister veterans' affairs told house, 000 afghans accessing homelessness support, government evicted, 000 afghans, including arap personnel, hotels.
could minister confirm still, 000 afghans accessing homelessness support?
need write.
member.

gentleman would imagine.
additional route afghan citizens resettlement scheme.
indeed, arap acrs offer covers afghan citizens served alongside armed forces worked alongside diplomatic missions—or simply prominent afghan government society, therefore feel relocation necessary protection—up point.
arap acrs matched, quite generosity scope, schemes many countries part nato force afghanistan/ wider donor community afghanistan, opportunities people leave afghanistan resettle elsewhere enormous.
proud schemes,, today' announcement notwithstanding, incredibly generous.
moving best pace move people country difficult.
think right.
member haltemprice howden( david davis) could put better talked debt honour owe served armed forces afghanistan.
sure members sides house appalled fact, years later, situation still completely resolved.
minister rightly highlighted challenges posed lack documentation cases, given, individuals, obtaining documentation often mean applying taliban- controlled passport office, minister say government ensuring affected route get necessary documentation safe efficient manner?, going share detail house, absolutely nobody' interests taliban know.
