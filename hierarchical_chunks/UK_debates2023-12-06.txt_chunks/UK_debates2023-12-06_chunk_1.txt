quite apart important recommendations, bishop james' report laid bare truly devastating experiences bereaved hillsborough disaster 15 april 1989.
unimaginable tragedy unfolded: 97 innocent men, women children ultimately lost lives; hundreds injured traumatised saw.
hillsborough' bereaved survivors, terrible day day one enduring ordeal, days decades thereafter, became clear suffered double injustice.
first, abject failure police others ground protect loved ones—failures described lord justice taylor' 1990 report “blunders first magnitude”., faced years unforgivable institutional defensiveness.
secondly, hillsborough families survivors suffered described cruelty, innocent fans cynically blamed deaths., later become clear, web lies spun seeking protect reputations.
emphasise point although disaster may 34 years ago, baseless narratives inexplicably persist quarters today, let take important opportunity restate matter opinion, unassailable fact: fans attending hillsborough stadium 15 april 1989 bear absolutely responsibility deaths injuries occurred.
making statement, echo said seven years ago right.
friend member maidenhead dispatch box read full findings second inquests—namely, 96 men, women children unlawfully killed.
since, andrew devine, suffered life- changing injuries hillsborough, passed away 27 july 2021, becoming 97th fatality disaster.
would like place record deepest sympathies devine' family friends, indeed lost loved ones.
government' response bishop james' report long time coming—too long.
time, necessarily held back avoid prejudicing outcomes criminal trials, delay since recognise compounded pain hillsborough families survivors.
government apologise.
house aware, government' response follows police, published january year.
today, chief coroner also publishing response, relates leadership role regarding coronial service.
collectively, responses address points raised bishop james, stop., course, continue listen families involved major incidents concerns.
bishop james' report contains 25 points learning.
said considered “vitally important”, clear three particular, use word, “crucial”, let turn.
first, proposed creation charter families bereaved public tragedy.
bishop james made clear wanted “help bring cultural change” commitments change “related transparency acting public interest.
worth reflecting, setting point learning 13 regarding hillsborough law, come, bishop james says “drawn heavily” law' principles drafting charter, worth taking moment consider language charter.
commits signatories—the leaders public bodies—to strive place public interest reputation organisations; approach forms public scrutiny, including public inquiries inquests, candour open, honest transparent way; avoid seeking defend indefensible.
prime minister today signed known hillsborough charter behalf government.
signatories charter include national police chiefs' council behalf 43 police forces, college policing, crown prosecution service, national fire chiefs council others.
want charter become part culture means public servant, prime minister writing departments ensure everyone works government aware hillsborough charter means way work.
reference charter also added central induction civil service new joiners.
hillsborough charter bishop james' report also added curriculum every recruit joins police.
charter embedded public life.
second crucial point learning bishop james' report described “pressing need” “proper participation bereaved families inquests”.
inquests, first foremost, answering four questions:,, individual died.
however, bishop james highlighted, hillsborough families let process given answers first inquests, endure second, ordered right.
friend member maidenhead.
first inquests, families forced fund legal representation, single barrister.
recognise proper involvement inquest, appropriate cases, mean bereaved families get legal representation, especially state represented.
changes made, hillsborough tragedy happened today, families would eligible free legal aid exceptional case funding scheme.
government determined make process straightforward possible, january 2022 ministry justice removed means test representation relation ecf cases september 2023 means test removed legal advice inquests.
want build progress, announce today consult expansion legal aid families bereaved public disaster independent public advocate engaged—i come back that—or aftermath terrorist incident.
acknowledge bishop james talks broadly proper participation bereaved families inquests state represented.
seek understand experiences individuals, would welcome conversation bishop james early new year.
support principle raised bishop james' report public bodies able spend “limitless” public funds legal representation., first time, set requirement government departments “consider number lawyers instructed bearing mind commitment support inquisitorial approach.
go set central government public bodies publish spend legal representation inquests inquiries, reaffirming spend proportionate, never excessive.
also published set principles guide public bodies instruct lawyers inquests.
include requirement approach inquest openness honesty keep mind bereaved heart inquest process.
also publish guidance set clear expectation central government public bodies must instruct lawyers accordance principles hillsborough charter, lawyers engage inquest process bereaved families matters.
shall turn third bishop james' three crucial points learning: duty candour police officers.
described, “a gap police accountability arrangements” officers “fail cooperate fully investigations alleged criminal offences misconduct.
new offence police corruption, applicable police national crime agency officers introduced 2017, punishable 14 years' imprisonment.
2020, updated police( conduct) regulations introduce new duty co- operate individual officers investigations inquiries.
failure result disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal.
last month, introduced legislation place organisational duty candour policing.
criminal justice bill, place duty college policing issue code practice ethical policing, code include duty candour.
duty designed promote culture openness, honesty transparency, chief constables held account forces' performance code.
new code practice laid today.
want go beyond police consider healthcare settings.
response recent concerns openness settings, conducting review effectiveness existing duty candour health social care providers—the terms reference published today.
aware hillsborough law calls duty candour public authorities.
since hillsborough disaster, comprehensive framework duties obligations developed, covers public officials different official proceedings, inquests inquiries.
first, central government, civil service code requires civil servants act honesty integrity.
breach code result range sanctions, including dismissal. sits alongside nolan principles providing: “holders public office act solely terms public interest.
secondly, legal framework surrounding criminal investigations, statutory inquiries, inquests formal proceedings requires individuals, regardless whether public official, co- operate.
example, duty candour judicial review, amounts duty public authorities lay cards “face table”. comes inquiries, importantly, carry potential custodial sanction—prison sentences plain english.
thirdly, public official demonstrates lack candour, forms part duty public office holder, potentially guilty misconduct public office, criminal offence.
keep changes review ensure achieve culture openness, honesty candour, rule taking action needed.
today, government respond 25 points learning, focused statement bishop james described “crucial”.
meaningful progress made, hesitate go required.
discussions continue, government committed another debate new year ensure dialogue progresses.
would also happy meet hillsborough families wish discuss aspect government' response.
finally, turn improvements justice system.
bishop james made searingly clear justice system, supported victims bereaved tragedy, set.
response sets steps government taken ensure bereaved families survivors immediate aftermath public tragedy guided difficult, complicated forbidding process.
victims prisoners bill, introduced legislation enable independent public advocate.
established, ipa strong voice victims, bereaved whole communities affected major incidents.
ipa, promised right.
friend member maidenhead, make sure affected major incidents know rights, access support services, voices heard inquests inquiries.
design informed difficulties hillsborough families faced commitment making sure families suffer injustices.
include holding public bodies account commitments abide hillsborough charter.
also grateful contributions families victims grenfell tower fire manchester arena bombing, telling would helped aftermath terrible events.
listening concerns hillsborough families, set powerfully met earlier year, well contributions colleagues across house—i looking right.
member garston halewood here—i decided must go establishing permanent ipa.
vital ipa deployed soon possible disaster strikes time advance prepared possible.
permanent advocate able advise government response major incidents, subsequent inquiries reviews, ensure views families heard.
importantly, also report independently government experiences victims bereaved families, well publishing annual report.
reports laid.
hillsborough families unrelenting pursuit justice, bishop james done essential work support families faithfully discharged commission put upon home secretary former prime minister capture perspective, lost following second inquests.
today therefore important day.
provide closure families, course.
bishop james wrote, “there closure love, someone loved lost.. grief indeed journey without destination.
today milestone journey.
moment, hope, families feel able pause take quiet pride enormity achieved,, others—for british people.
hope serve cement strengthen hillsborough families' legacy—the changes made benefit entire nation help ensure never people betrayed organisations institutions meant protect.
commend statement house.
call shadow minister.
customary thank government advance sight statement, given gravity matter, fact report responded government many years length secretary state' statement morning, disappointed received copy statement much later customary.
describe events 15 april 1989 “far- reaching” wholly inadequate.
say “tragic” misses point.
name “hillsborough” stands day indictment institutions, individuals entire culture transparency, accountability even simple human compassion absent.
child 1989, 95 people died hillsborough stadium worst sporting disaster nation' history.
ten years later, alongside thousands law students, learnt shockwaves events day still sending courts, continuing pain families. included death 1993 96th victim, 22- year- old anthony bland, spent four years persistent vegetative state court made legal history agreeing best interests withdraw feeding tube.
let forget two years ago disaster claimed 97th victim, 55- year- old andrew devine, lived serious brain injury three decades.
34 years, say justice delayed justice denied would significant understatement context.
simply unendurable family made wait long justice.
wish echo words secretary state paying tribute bishop james jones; many campaigners, inside outside house, worked long establish truth;,, bereaved families.
gone beyond anyone endure secure justice loved ones victims future disasters.
inspiration, speak whole house saying know debt owe.
turn detail remarks secretary state.
purpose government' response must centred experience families, bishop james' report, ensure suffering remembered, crucially, never repeated.
commitment opposition,, make: work ensure government' proposals deliver meaningful justice.
welcome commitment consult expanding legal aid families bereaved public disaster, nothing seen government date goes far believe necessary require public authorities act candour transparency.
public, duty public bodies forthcoming truth basic requirement justice done wake terrible events scar communities change lives forever.
many shocked hear already exist matter law.
hillsborough law campaign, government know, includes bereaved families still fighting accountability 34 years later, told without effective duty candour place, risk reform simply add another layer bureaucracy victims must already endure.
reason year ago, leader opposition committed hillsborough law would first foremost impose legal duty public institutions, public servants officials act public interest transparency, candour frankness major incident.
secretary state knows sought amend recent bill introduce effective duty candour passage, approach government far rejected.
continue efforts regard, government' requirement code ethics enough.
also welcome commitment standing, independent public advocate, supported change victims prisoners bill.
however, secretary state knows, also believe—and said repeatedly—that duty candour missing piece, vital add make effective changes introduced respect independent public advocate.
issue party politics, duty say government announced yet go far enough.
must deliver vital promise happened 1989, continued happen families 34 years, never happen.
thank.
lady response, shall seek address point turn.
issue legal aid, absolutely accept particular case manifest completely unacceptable lack equality arms, treated adversarial process, completely inimical inquiry designed get bottom.
culture wrong, terms lawyers approached, equality arms non- existent.
sought address two ways.
first, appropriate cases become adversarial people defensive probably got something wrong, necessary families legal arms take., happened today, funding would place.
small amounts funding; total amount spent, quite properly—i complaints this—in second inquest around £65 million.
significant change already made.
say, consulting whether go still.
critical issue, course, candour.
importance changing culture runs bishop james jones' report like message stick rock.
across house—as. lady rightly pointed, party political issue—we must everything possible change culture.
ipa, important note point learning, charter, bishop james said: “i welcome government' commitment…to create independent public advocate act bereaved families public disaster.
public advocate appointed, offer charter benchmark may assess way public bodies treat bereaved public tragedy”, going talk text charter.
hope play important part embedding culture holding people account, job.
continue discussion, look forward engaging.

lord chancellor appears accept principle; also accept point, public tire hearing promised cultural change without visible action accompanying?
secondly, police officer disciplined convicted offence relating hillsborough disaster.
