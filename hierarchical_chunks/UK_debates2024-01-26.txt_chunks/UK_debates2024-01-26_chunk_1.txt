beg move, bill read second time.
access telecommunications networks bill seeks ensure, wherever someone lives, choose operator mobile phone connect.
westminster hall debate wednesday, inevitable element repetition, something worth saying, probably worth saying twice, good cross- party support improving speeding roll- shared rural network.
network government' scheme increase 4g coverage 91% 95% land mass 2025, welcome, government' investment half billion pounds new masts total notspots signal available.
however, roll- progressing quickly would like, bill seeks improve speed rate people places constituency cockshutt, woore west felton get usable phone signal one provider wherever travel local area.
improved rural coverage really important sorts reasons.
importantly, one top issues raised constituents—i series open meetings summer came time something people find frustrating daily lives—and issue, issue.
one reasons keen pursue place.
according survey country land business association, 80% rural business owners said improved connectivity would make single largest improvement business.
partly struggle recruit, linked poor public transport, also important people might want employ able access wider range job opportunities work flexibly home way always currently available people rural areas.
mobile phones cited default back- option power cut copper landline network switched next couple years.
emphasise concerning, particularly elderly constituents might little less familiar “voice internet” technology, well everybody area worried happens big power cut occurs.
rural, power put back online quickly urban areas, back- batteries routers last one two hours, sometimes much longer.
someone home dark frightened might want able call someone emergency services event power cut.
really important people access mobile provider—whoever might be—when power.
respondents survey recently conducted building digital cited poor mobile coverage major factor exacerbating poor outcomes agricultural injuries.
wish dwell disaster, couple years ago saw number combine harvester fires across constituency.
people partial notspot, already ring 999 phone, situation might want call sorts people help.
999 calls needed.
year ago, shift ambulance crew, crew used mobile signal download patient data tablets help patients' conditions.
visited elderly lady near ellesmere poorly, although quite close town centre, crew could download medical record, care necessarily compromised compared somebody urban area might expect.
finally, improved rural coverage would reduce digital inequality, talked lot place.
many people feel comfortable full broadband- connected computer learned use phone—it part everyday life—and cannot use move around daily routine, left great extent.
understand technical challenges building masts rural areas—not least getting power supply there—and disparity rural urban areas.
fact life living rural area—i think people understand that—but north shropshire one worst served areas country.
less 60% premises coverage indoors operators, average whole 86%.
move away towns villages, less one three choose operator home.
know—we talked length minister acknowledged oral questions recently—the coverage data optimistic always reflect happening ground.
example, north shropshire talk people trefonen, maps say coverage lived experience.
also capacity issue whereby coverage might calls might drop regularly people linked mast time.
data use assess success roll- therefore important.
mentioned, shared rural network involved four mobile network operators spending half billion pounds end partial notspots.
ee already extensive network mobile masts, already met obligations even though deadline june 2024—it six months ahead—but according reports daily telegraph, three providers requested delay.
number reasons, difficult overcome, lack planning resource, logistical challenges mentioned earlier, issues access land.
impacting delivery shared rural network.
interesting single mast delivered government total notspots built yet, according house commons library briefing.
challenges difficult overcome, part problem ee shared masts, failed reach agreement mobile network operators.
commercial issue part commercial negotiations, whether ee asking high rate, whether mobile operators offering low rate, matter perspective, reality could achieved better coverage without blighting countryside loads additional masts operators shared network equipment effectively.
bill comes, would ensure operators share equipment wherever possible, would penalise.
rate would share would determined ofcom help ease commercial discussion along.
sometimes sharing possible—sometimes bigger, wider, stronger mast needed might possible—and brings solution rural roaming, strongly opposed industry.
industry argues causes shortened battery life, people might drop calls, deal total notspots, perhaps importantly, would undermine future investment, presumably competitive advantage would undermined.
however, environment, food rural affairs committee report 2019 said would achieve equivalent result shared rural network achievable around 18 months.
ofcom report 2018 said cost appear disproportionate.
since reports, shared rural network agreement signed, significant concerns speed roll-, quality data using judge success, fact yesterday' technology yet countryside—while rest country hoping get 5g stand- alone 5g near future.
bill would address shortfalls requiring secretary state improve rural roaming incentivising companies engage work.
conclusion, cannot emphasise enough—separately mechanism bill—the importance better data shared rural network assessed objectives, see people experiencing ground.
know rural roaming happen unless force companies, already shown strong resistance, government acknowledged.
bill would work alongside shared rural network taking steps improve infrastructure sharing encouraging rural roaming wherever possible.
people might operator works home, could day mum falls home.
might call ambulance, cannot get hold person tell.
problematic modern age.
need ensure people rural areas connected wherever go, home place work.
matt rodda( reading east)( lab): address number issues responding official opposition, take opportunity underline importance increasing access broadband wider need greater connectivity.
bill.
member north shropshire( helen morgan) would two effects, understand.
first, would require mobile network operators share network infrastructure reasonable price.
secondly, would incentivise operators allow customers companies roam network.
mentioned, known rural roaming, similar happens travelling abroad.
measures intended tackle partial notspots, worth noting bill would address total notspots—areas receive coverage mobile network operator.
turning first effects, occasional concerns telecom networks infrastructure access.
understand, one main issues areas, city hull, monopoly company—in case, kcom—or situations across rest country openreach monopoly provider.
across country, repeated issues use telecoms infrastructure, particular repeated digging roads.

open debate spirit honesty, truth transparency—a trinity lacking exchanges thus far ministry defence mounting concerns' nuclear trident programme.
spiralling costs programme, financial human, demand earnest response ministers—something hitherto eluded mod—but hoping candour honesty today, writing forthcoming weeks.
economics trident programme straightforward.
per house commons library, total acquisition expenditure four vanguard- class submarines housing trident missiles £12.
52 billion, equates approximately £21 billion today' money.
additionally, annual- service costs currently estimated% defence budget—based current planned expenditure, another £3 billion 2023- 24., cost design manufacture new dreadnought- class submarines estimated £31 billion, including inflation life programme.
£10 billion contingency also set aside, making current potential total replacement £41 billion.- service costs expected continue approximately% defence expenditure.
national audit office raised concerns impact mod' nuclear programme based affordability department' overall equipment plan, astronomical figures continue spent.

secondly, based incidents, growing scepticism overall preparedness existing vanguard fleet light allegedly dangerous “rotting” state, referenced dominic cummings, former senior adviser former prime minister.
thirdly, consequence nuclear exposure hazards imposed population scotland lack transparency concerning programme whole, set nation scotland much gain removing nuclear arsenal waters.
