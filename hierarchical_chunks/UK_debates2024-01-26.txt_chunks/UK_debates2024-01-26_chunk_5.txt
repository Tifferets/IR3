, defence, freedom information act 2000 invoked withhold information scotland people—the people frequently placed risk exposure radiation kept dark.
formulaic tests public information versus national interest simply good enough.
would like pointedly ask minister: approximately much nuclear material transported aldermaston coulport last 12 months past five years?
many convoys used, frequency transports?
many workers sufficiently close impacted even low- level nuclear exposure?
need answers, people deserve basic information.
even details potentially catastrophic incidents received media coverage routinely denied right.. members house public alike, spurious grounds ministry comment operational matters respect submarines.
recently reported royal navy nuclear submarine plunged towards crush depth due concerning malfunction main depth gauge.
finally reported last november, incident took place year.
still specifics took place, despite personal request information ministry.
turning preparedness vanguard fleet, september 2023, one vanguard- class submarines returned patrol six months.
defence commentators noted double three- month missions previously completed.
additionally, navy lookout reported returning submarine seemed missing exterior tiles covered marine growth extent seen.
year, life expectancy current vanguard fleet repeatedly extended, despite three four vessels currently seaworthy.
would like credit national newspaper scotland persistent thorough reportage nuclear predicament scotland.
case submarines failing seaworthiness labouring increased operational pressures, indicated malfunctioning vital components, extended periods deployment missing exterior tiles, radiation leaks- reported, ask minister good faith, people scotland right.. members place trust government?
specifically, dreadnought class avoid exactly fate, critically, additional safeguards taken mitigate civilian exposure nuclear contamination, given shocking evidence?
given chief adviser erstwhile prime minister referred' nuclear fleet “horror show”, would hope minister would come degree information transparency, rely merely obfuscation.
brings third final concern.
deficit trust one many reasons people scotland would benefit becoming independent state lieu held union.
“bairns bombs” one galvanising messages independence movement run- 2014 referendum.
slogan embodied persisting sentiment nuclear weapons mass destruction dangerous corrosive impact country planet.
opinion poll opinion poll shows majority scottish people oppose wmds hosted scotland.
whenever independence mentioned government, immediate reaction attempt assert scottish economy better served part.
within realm defence manufacturing, argument far reality possible.
october, government signed contracts totalling £4 billion design manufacture world' advanced submarines.
however much disagree principle- called nuclear deterrent, illustrates perfectly fact scotland receives manufacturing jobs, located barrow-- furness, raynesway derby.
jobs, growth capital yet directed anywhere scotland.
meanwhile, rotting hulks dreadnought subs retired 1980s rusting away rosyth longer service.
people scotland precarious future, key economic infrastructure grangemouth oil refinery threatened closure.
current situation bleak, would like end speech pessimistic note.
instead, look towards future hope: future independent scotland build benefit vast renewable energy potential, rather host nuclear weapons; future safe, feasible practicable way ensure independent scotland begin life nuclear wmd- free state day one independence; future government people scotland longer kept dark dangers placed midst remote, arrogant london administration.

best guesstimate, many different moving parts, kind number talking.
huge number, legislation important affected.

, however, often miss groups society forgotten fall legislative cracks loopholes laws.
pleased say bill impact tens thousands people across, nobody house wider society would want.
title, fundamentally loss partner, wife mother childbirth, ensuring left behind right leave horrendous circumstances.
house rightly annual debate child loss, impacts many people year year., unimaginable grief, yet like many issues, life events tragedies, left unsaid undebated raised member.
husband parent, cannot comprehend losing partner childbirth, indeed like child lose either parents birth.
phrase, “it would make anyone' blood run cold, probably grave understatement.
trauma unimaginable, yet every year proportion families must endure tragic circumstances: unimaginable joy becoming parent, facing devastating grief losing person planned next part life, somehow raise child alone.
like many colleagues across house, party committed boosting safeguarding employment parental rights recent decades.
recent years, bills passed neonatal care, supporting people baby loss, course, shared parental leave, always much.
bill tabled seeks give day- one right leave parents tragic circumstances meet current continuity service requirements, guaranteed leave entitlement process grief change personal circumstances, along job return able.
want mention.

minute rule bill respect constituent aaron.
leave speak circumstances, pay tribute tenacious way lobbied issue past year.
equally, mentioning confess bill little different—or perhaps lot—from original bill, making progress issue.
sincere, genuine hope bill start process debate making changes specific area law months years come.
pleased labour party, given privilege serve country following general election, whenever comes, plan improve employment rights, including new parents, hope lobby labour ministers years ahead.
numbers behind issue concerning, sorry say going wrong direction.
data released weeks ago mbrrace, monitors cause maternal deaths, stillbirths infant deaths, highlights number women dying year pregnancy, soon, increased highest level 20 years,.
41 deaths per 100, 000 women.
even troubling black, asian minority ethnic women, economically deprived areas, severely affected.
women ethnic backgrounds remain four times likely die pregnancy, asian backgrounds twice likely die compared caucasian women.
figures seen since early 2000s.
government' stated ambition halve maternal mortality rates 2010 2025, yet numbers clearly paint different picture.
clear maternal deaths rising, partners spouses left unenviable heart- wrenching circumstance bringing newborn, planning funeral adjusting life without significant.
dealing trio issues, last thing many want thinking worrying leave employment.
parental leave something proud country, means perfect.
making easier accessible individuals incredibly difficult circumstances something sure colleagues across house support.

many, even process getting set scheme arduous, nearly 10% eligible mothers fathers stating complex set manage.
furthermore, due strict eligibility criteria spl, approximately 40% working fathers left without leave entitlement.
includes, limited, fathers whose partner working entitled maternity leave, fathers insecure work, fathers changed jobs partner became pregnant, fathers lower incomes.
childhood bereavement network made important point parents babies may particularly risk financial strain younger.
partner, lost childbirth, may less time build earnings, make mortgage payments contribute pension schemes, less likely planned future finances.
dads currently entitled slp partner' insecure employment prior death may therefore among vulnerable financially.
heard lot stats figures behind issue, important name understand lived experiences behind figures.
want read, words, happened simon thorpe.
lived experience means, employer, supports change law: “my wife first child august 2020 months later wife diagnosed terminal cancer.

bill sets following changes.
would make shared parental leave pay father partner, mother child died, day- one employment right.
recognise already provision law shared parental leave case bereavement, subject strict continuity employment test, minister knows.
stands, mother' partner take shared parental leave, must working least 26 weeks 66 weeks baby due, must earned least £390 total across 30 66 weeks.
partner must also employed continuously employer least 26 weeks end 15th week due date.
must also stay employer start leave period.
short, lot fixed conditions world people change jobs careers frequently previous generations.
bill would allow secretary state remove test regulations.

hope bill passes second reading, open important debate.
present, loophole legislation leaving parents guardians without sufficient time grieve, plan adjust life without mother child.
urge colleagues give due consideration bill' passing second reading.
stated, bill would make massive difference small number cases year families experience life- changing circumstances.
