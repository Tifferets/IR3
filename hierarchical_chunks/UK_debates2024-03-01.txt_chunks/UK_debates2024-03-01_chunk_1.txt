yesterday, major counselling, therapeutic health organisations provisionally agreed indicative vote support bill, organisation voting.
british medical association royal college nursing support ban conversion practices.
let come evidence asked.
government survey 2017, recently commissioned piece work 2023, indicating live issue.
according research, one five people subject someone trying change, cure suppress sexual orientation transgender identity.
one five people religious faith background, one six non- religious background, experienced conversion therapy.. member devizes( danny kruger) attended one drop- briefings bill, asked number young people affected practices.
weighted yougov survey—using usual weighting metrics—of, 000 people 2023, 10% aged 65 said undergone offered conversion therapy, whereas figure% 16 17- year-
olds,% 18 34- year- olds—shockingly high.
shows live issue.
nspcc, heard: 50 young people phoned helpline last year, saying threatened, subjected, conversion practices.
know members would prefer bring ban sexual orientation conversion practices—lgb only—and touch transgender elements.
couple reasons think would foolish approach.
first, government carried reviews repeatedly said need trans- inclusive ban.
fact, ministers said trans conversion main concern.
cannot say huge concern people might converted transgender, say need ban either- way conversion therapy.
secondly, must recognise lgb transgender separate, interlinked.
people exploring sexual orientation sometimes come consider transgender status.
include transgender would allow loophole whereby people wanted force someone gay, trans, could claim offering transgender therapy, rather lgb therapy, would make bill useless.
thirdly, pretty well- established research lgb conversion therapy problem, significant growing research, around world, conversion therapy problem transgender community well.
fact, minister women equalities, right.
member saffron walden( kemi badenoch), said letter february significant evidence children might subjected conversion practices transgender.
seen evidence—i endorse per se—but seen significant accounts many survivors forced transgender.
sides saying happening.
direction conversion irrelevant, indication need take action, bill.. friend mentioned nspcc' report challenges young people facing sexuality gender identity.
findings include, 400 children young people last year wanted talk counsellors worries sexuality gender identity.
children described instances emotional abuse family home, including constant shouting, hurtful comments threats violence.
children threatened, undergone, form conversion practice intended cure sexuality gender identity.. friend agree, passing bill, help prevent children subjected, send clear message allow people suffer painful abuse- called conversion practices? quite agree.
bill stops parents sending children conversion practices; promise solve world lgbt people.
cannot promise parents shout abusive, people say nasty things—i afraid nature democratic society sometimes.
stop premeditated purposes, processes, courses conduct activities aim something cannot done.
every bill world topic done.
bill goes directions.
whatever direction conversion, abhorrent must stopped.
said existing legislation covers violent physical acts, course does—violent, abusive bullying coercion harassment caught current crimes—but government' 2021 consultation said new criminal law needed fill gap physical abuse process causes long- term harm.
bill therefore makes clear statement conversion practices illegal egregious cases prosecuted.
avoids clashing existing laws focused harm—doing would result survivors retraumatised lengthy court battles—and instead looks intent behind actions.
get balance right, bill clarifies certain actions constitute offence.. gentleman talking abusive practices practices cause harm.
course, condemn anything abusive, says, vast majority acts already covered law, bill actually mention abuse, indeed harm.
threshold harm beyond practice, could speech- based activity, unlawful.
example, detransitioner—he mentioned keira bell—trying persuade individual go ahead surgery hormone treatment would permanent impact could caught bill, yet many would say harmful abusive; fact, opposite.
would person caught bill?
believe bill would catch people express personal reservations certain processes; would catch people prepared programmes activities, ad hoc activities.
come safeguard moment.
exactly need get words safeguards right, need bill committee.
must reject bill,.
lady might find go frying pan fire.
bill allows ministers northern ireland scotland enact within jurisdictions, consent respective national legislators.
creates offences relation people sent abroad, uses existing language law provide fines issued.
aim lock people stop practice.
key bill contained definition “conversion practice”, must “a course conduct activity”.
course conduct english law something happens, activity ad hoc planned intervention.
include one-, impromptu actions; must predetermined purpose.
higher threshold immediate intent.
predetermined outcome must indicated course conduct activity started,.
provision protects people thoughtful conversations, could course question people via process.
bill says: “to change someone' sexual orientation change person transgender” includes “to suppress sexual orientation transgender identity”.
know nervous wording, must clear suppression must level negating identity orientation.
means orientation must changed way.
many gay people never sex.
many transgender people wear gendered clothes.
actions constitute suppression; negate orientation identity full part.
cannot claimed wording therefore overreach.
bill would use pre- existing terms laws describe “sexual orientation”, “transgender” “transgender identity”.
received interesting representation past days use term “being transgender”, rather interchangeable terms “transgender” “transgender identity”, “transgender” clearly defined law moment.
better wording, sort thing would willingly accept committee, discussion.
real reason get committee work details.
sexual orientation, course, defined equality act 2010 terms person sexual feelings towards() persons sex,() persons opposite sex,() persons either sex.
definition used
