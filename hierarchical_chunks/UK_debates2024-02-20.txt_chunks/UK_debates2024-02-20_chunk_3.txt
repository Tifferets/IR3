poll tax scots watching national team.
qualifying games—a number enthralling, wins home spain away norway, available view many people fortunate enough able go match able pay viaplay.
unfair unjust refereeing error var review punishes team.
meant scots fans missed well- earned success team.
even worse, euro finals past qualifiers world cup north begin, scots deprived opportunity watch team free-- air tv.
games go another competition beckons, many scots excluded watching team' journey, neither right fair.
norm europe, seven countries including scotland northern ireland situation; case england, qualifying games free air itv channel since 2018.

similarly, bbc holds rights england- 21 internationals scotland' left scottish football association website, shows respect men' team across genders ages scots deprived right watch national team.
fixtures also matter fans.
scottish football press described fans typewriters; seems broadcasters fans tv stations, scottish press supported scottish team, broadcasters seem support england.
broadcasters revealing television outlets, team england.
happening whether talking state- funded bbc, publicly owned channel, commercial itv stv channels broadcasting obligations beyond border.
may blame scottish football association, sold rights viaplay.

sfa duty game scotland.
responsibility runs grassroots football simply game enjoyed youngsters, developing pathways people continue playing whatever age standard, entering professional ranks, ultimately, pinnacle national team.
sfa also required nurture develop men' game, growing women' game football among people different ages capacities.
men' women' international teams pinnacle, sfa' remit covers.
comes cost, however, sfa required fund.
money tight associations, individuals.
broadcasting money applies nations ireland premier league games south border shown denied scotland.
reason classed one broadcasting entity international football divergence relevance.
hence cash- strapped sfa needs maximise income, rights show national teams' fixtures major asset.
viaplay offers.
something sfa required promote game grassroots international teams.
broadcasters?
bbc, channel itv budgets pay england games, scottish ones?
sfa seeking fa—quite opposite.
viewing rights fee scotland matches significantly lower england matches, transfer fees scottish premier leagues lower english premier league.
broadcasters prepared pay top dollar show england games, prepared fund bawbee scotland game.
indeed, stated simon pitts stv gave evidence scottish affairs committee.
said “very little prospect larger commercial return- wide, turn determines level bid.
scots tv licence fees, therefore, matter, obligations scots viewers count little.
licence fee paid scots rights given scotland broadcasters matched coverage.
