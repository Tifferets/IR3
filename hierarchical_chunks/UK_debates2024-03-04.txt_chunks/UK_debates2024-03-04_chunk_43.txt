colleagues said, home affairs committee found neal diligent committed public servant.
minister share chief inspector' concern unaccompanied child migrants?
reported playing unsuitable games—trying bet one would first go foster care—and ages overestimated, resulting children sharing bedrooms much older adults.
minister propose follow issues chief inspector raised?
right.
lady know area concerned.
issue unaccompanied asylum- seeking children never, ever subject game.
think horrified hear incident, following inspection findings, department launched immediate investigation inappropriate behaviour support worker, removed site immediately return.
said, seven hotels used accommodate unaccompanied asylum- seeking children since closed.
department taken recommendations seriously, lot learning future take forward work, including wider work local authorities safeguarding vulnerable children.
welcome minister' earlier assurance afghans fought otherwise supported troops taliban.
explain, benefit au fait details dispute, reason reports published earlier, level decision publish taken?
published sooner, would inspector job, would looking replacement?
gone termination inspector' appointment house: lost confidence home secretary, information shared media ought shared; confidential, outside appropriate publication process.
publication reports, cannot speak earlier decisions made previous ministers, said clearly number occasions would get respond reports, precisely done.
also reassure house today—i think important, house interested point—that respond reports within eight weeks.
arguably lives letter spirit commitment james brokenshire made years ago, held role.
reports, cumulatively, remarkable catalogue past failings, may invite minister look ahead?
referred rwanda scheme; agree incoming independent inspector must allowed examine workings scheme, implemented unless next inspector given satisfactory bill health?
course next inspector decide programme work, disagree right.
gentleman latter point.
would argue lives stake, every day people lose lives channel one day many.
making progress seeing commitment put end channel crossings, rwanda policy absolutely front centre; next piece jigsaw comes putting evil criminal gangs business, wait longer absolutely necessary get deliver work.
rwanda policy cost £500 million —an approximate cost £2 million individual government seeking transport rwanda.
bill ever implemented, good value taxpayer?
hear lot criticism, constructive suggestion.
gentleman would absence rwanda policy.
said, engage properly thoroughly national audit office figures, continue committed providing transparency around figures annual report accounts.
rwanda policy important part answer comes putting end criminal gangs terrible criminality oversee.
crucially, saving lives, get deliver policy.,
doubt, opportunity next weeks vote bill, help operationalise policy put evil criminal gangs business.
borders inspectorate found staff working home office-
run hotel made unaccompanied asylum- seeking children play disgraceful game find child next placed foster care, practice certain cause distress already traumatised children.
report found agency workers employed look children young nine insufficient background checks training.
minister done ensure understands full extent risks children asylum system, steps taking end disgraceful practices, guarantee everyone working children properly vetted trained?.
lady right say everybody working children properly vetted.
taken seriously recommendations neal made response issue.
said right.
member hackney north stoke newington( abbott), terrible situation.
accountability relation individual thought appropriate play game,, member house right- minded person, abhorrent.. member dulwich west norwood( helen hayes) right say talking children difficult circumstances awful lot.
individuals—i would use word “professionals”—have responsibility care children, behave appropriate way befitting role.

david neal, icibi, raised concerns immigration, sacked.
post vacant months.
minister said independent scrutiny plays important role, agree government, independent scrutiny valued, becoming sackable offence?
clear house basis neal' contract terminated.
think appropriate share confidential information way; outside process publication.
however, said repeatedly, want get appoint successor.
chief inspector borders immigration important role remit; house government see value.
looking done bridge gap absence full- time, permanent chief inspector.
doubt say work concluded.
chair-
party parliamentary group africa, met david neal number times.
incredibly impressive, robust, well- informed, detail, entirely independent.
beggars belief government ignored reports long—publication essential scrutiny—sacked teams, dumped reports.
minister believe home office perfect, everything going well, scrutiny?
case everything going badly, including rwanda, asylum backlog border security, hope improvement change government?
interesting observation, sits behind, afraid, lack policy lack alternative, credible approach borders immigration.
neal said response reports laid last week: “i think' real positive reports published.
think bodes well home secretary gripped officials getting reports published quickly”.
agree.
promised would lay reports; got done, table outstanding reports within eight- week window, moving forward.
last week' figures showed 46, 000 people still asylum hotels.
david neal' report said: “there evidence home office strategy end hotel use, recommended icibi 2022.
right,?
afraid right.
lady consistently votes strategy end use hotels, colleagues opposition front bench back benches.
way address issue hotels: diversify accommodation offer; ensure local authority areas engage properly dispersed accommodation—i encourage members house take interest performance local authority—and bring larger sites, brought forward.
crucially, reduce flow people coming across channel arriving country illegally.
every time opposition members chance something flow people arriving, undoubtedly leads pressures touches, refuse.
scandal really lies.
government' failure tackle asylum backlog, minister' inability grapple asylum hotel issue, staggering cost rwanda deal, £2 million per person taken country, reason minister broken home office budget, come cap hand next week, asking extra £5. billion funding home office?
afraid.
member yet another opposition member credible alternative speak of—just lots complaints work government.
making progress.
said, last year, number people arrived via channel third compared year.
population accommodated hotels going, number hotels open reducing.
five billion pounds.
government making progress.
living commitments— five billion pounds.. member keep parroting figures chuntering back benches, would rather came forward credible alternative plan.
perhaps could conversation.
shambles ongoing mismanagement borders government mismanagement huge asylum backlog, referred, enhanced additional shambles unnecessary interregnum.
answer right.
friend member orkney shetland( carmichael), minister seemed imply independent oversight would necessary next weeks months interregnum rwanda deal.
government right—in best- case scenario, perspective—1% asylum seekers go rwanda.
apparently, important independent oversight necessary period.
minister confirm new inspector formally fully appointed post, progress deporting anybody rwanda?
rather ironic.
gentleman argues due process one hand, says dispense.
contract chief inspector borders terminated respects actions accordance agreement around post. acceptable situation.
home secretary lost confidence, steps taken.
welcome oversight accountability.
opportunities scrutiny work rwanda.
point.
gentleman sought suggest made, clear saying waste time lives risk channel.
waste moment getting operationalising rwanda policy, course plenty opportunity scrutiny work.
may put record thanks minister work one constituents last week, ensuring one ukrainian babies got back northern ireland?
