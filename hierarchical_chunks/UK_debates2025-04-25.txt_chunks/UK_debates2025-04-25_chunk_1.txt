think labour changed position drastically relatively short space time?
immigration apparently bad?
profound question.
know labour got situation.
suspect sort fear reform, whose members today, labour probably right frightened.

labour given scotland advantage immigration could.
beyond wit scottish nation ensure immigration system specific tax code, need means.
another issue wish take, addressed response intervention, idea scotland get migrants rest uk—that want come scotland.

regardless successful attracting people, still situation long- term population decline scotland.
population, demography scotland bigger horror story, one thing really need look.
22% scotland' population 65, one highest ratios whole western world—i think figure england 17%.
birth rate one child every three women—again, one worst rates whole industrialised world.
need lecture.
members birth rate means.
need two children every woman sustain population current levels; birth rate one child every three women cannot sustainable.
makes two- child benefit cap absurd, heinous callous.
government working contrary need scotland address issues.
therefore, given falling birth rate, entirely dependent immigration keep population current levels, maybe increase modestly prospects economic growth.
one ambitions commitments government sticking cut net migration—that absolute utter mission.
even bring forward youth mobility scheme glory concern impact net migration.
scotland burdened immigration system set government policies make situation much worse.
think consistently call power devolved?
scottish labour mp stood opposed commitment.
going, give power allow.
world, populations western industrial countries facing difficulties.
got powers address them—we seen examples italy spain, particularly bad birth rates, almost par scotland.
ministries devoted trying increase birth rate something impending crisis coming way.
even china, population stagnation beginning take hold.
world population stop growing 2055, point stagnation rapid population fall.
point curve starts bend get stagnation, nations addressing issues.
look japan: historically resistant immigration, japan going structural economic crisis demography population issues.
population due fall 20% next 10 years falling birth rate.
going fall third gdp rankings 10th.
awaits course next 20 30 years.
government cannot look nose face; seeing reform, thinking, “how take; beat?
strategic thinking long- term vision towards end century starts take hold.
nothing, imagination, inquiry, going.
might blow members' minds, towards end century migrants might premium competition try get people nations around world.
know much start contemplate, going.
yet issue curbing migration.
