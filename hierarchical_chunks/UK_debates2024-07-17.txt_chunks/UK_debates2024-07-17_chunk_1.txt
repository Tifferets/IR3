imagine additional stresses strains members gladstone' day,, access parliamentary email address.
well part old county constituency, prescot southport also within boundaries old hundred west derby.
fact brought attention boundary commission announced last new southport constituency would, onwards, also contain tarleton hesketh bank, two beautiful villages south coast ribble.
result change, researched local library whereabouts boundary west derby hundred, hoping would able say tarleton hesketh bank, many years ago, also county division southport.
alas,.
quite hours research, realised information looking actually staring face along.
appears boundary hundreds west derby leyland lay along—would believe?
—boundary lane, boundary lane situated hamlet called hundred end.
lesson, think, ignoring obvious right front.
predecessors previous parliaments talked felt southport sometimes taken granted taken advantage, subsequently sought discuss elevate divisions towns local borough.
wish assure constituents take different approach.
instead, work ensure country' new government look cause divisions neighbours, whether countries thousands miles away even towns thousand yards away.
instead, work colleagues ensure government look unite country task national renewal, politics believe politics common good—a politics looks wellbeing, rather tries others.
many towns villages country seen better days past years.
southport different.
whereas areas, instance, much- needed housing built, much- needed transport links implemented—two issues pleased see new government planning address—southport' problems manifested temporary closure town' much- loved pier, town centre, whose main streets need fair share love attention.
promise work colleagues house beyond fix issues.
