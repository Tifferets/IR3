purpose legislation give people information shorter timeframe possible current mechanisms.
creating effective information recovery process relies conditional immunity model.
attended decent chunk debate house lords yesterday, although sympathetic intent behind lords amendment 44e, give family members role deciding whether immunity granted, immunity risks undermining effectiveness provisions principal aim information recovery.
example, “public interest” consideration element condition would lead uncertainty circumstances immunity granted, undermining clear transparent approach developed time.
ensure independent commission reconciliation information recovery obtain much information families possible, need ensure right incentives place individuals come forward provide information.

would minister acknowledge cross- party support—the ulster unionists deferred one small matter—and recommitted government irish government recently january 2020?
move forward different political issues came.
minister made point event weekend, chatham house rules allowed talk.
puts forward argument parties could agree, involved many discussions tell british government dragged feet month month around issue onward disclosure.

afraid quite believe case.
however, british government committed full disclosure icrir, allows huge amount information put forward circumstances possibility ensuring commissioner obtain much information possible families.
minister said families say whether immunity granted, would undermine whole thrust bill, point bill ensure people families hurt, traumatised damaged happened result terrorist activity northern ireland 30 years say.
surely best way giving justice, heard circumstances case, attitude individual disclosed, least let final say whether feel individual concerned granted immunity.
thank right.
gentleman point.
many amendments bill throughout last year included measures families engaged views heard throughout process.
ensure commission obtain much information families possible, need ensure right incentives place individuals come forward provide information.
possibility eligible individuals co- operate fully commission could prevented obtaining immunity prosecution highly likely act significant disincentive individuals disclose information.
never going easy issue, easy bill.
easy, would done many years ago.
government proposing may right, may part right part wrong.
certainly think giving survivors families right veto would wrong step take, government right.
however, think house find comfort fact secretary state keep progress enactment review, abuse things wrong, revisit, tidy make work better.
cannot seen closed chapter, job done.
rather, start new process—quite experimental ways—of learning people' experiences.

desperate see prosperity great country, things nation wants move look forward, rather continuously looking backwards.
thank.
friend point committed work department.
time, know.
understand point makes.
past year, endeavoured amendments make bill much focused victims troubles, victims, choose, contact commission start process hopefully get information relatively quick time.
recently example roman catholic priest involved ira activities.
talking role, said regret efforts effective killing people.
kind evidence elicited—if people come forward show remorse regret, offer comfort victims—does secretary state really think victims feel better?
would giving opportunity say, “in light man' attitude, believe granted immunity, better way ensuring justice least seen done people?
unbelievably evil things done course troubles.
unbelievably hideous acts committed, none change.
said beginning contribution, possible give justice huge number families even today, even passage time even numerous investigations cases.
bill tries get information families contact commission request, better understand situation.
change anything happened past—it simply cannot.
grateful secretary state giving way.
premise argument arguments heard members benches, sometimes extremely condescending victims going many decades, people come forward truth grant immunity.
well, one glaring example proves totally wrong.
bloody sunday inquiry, soldiers granted immunity within context inquiry.
one another, lied teeth, proven international public inquiry.
disappeared,, ira people provided immunity within context organisation looking find bodies, still bodies found people come forward tell truth even granted immunity.
lie used sell bill: lie.
patently untrue anything give people truth justice desire.. gentleman characterises completely incorrectly.
guarantees bill bring information forward, tried outline, little new information come light led new cases.
people able receive justice.
mentions point, past, people might misled judge- led inquiry.
well, perjury, perjury part bill.
bill changed huge amount past year, worthy support.
may well last chance discuss bill chamber.
may ask secretary state reflect fact virtually every independent human rights expert including, notably, northern ireland human rights commission, statutory functions, believe bill human rights compliant?
even declan morgan, appointed head icrir, could give categorical answer question recent newspaper interview.
indeed, anticipated whole series cases need brought forward clear issues around human rights compliance.
understand point,, purpose amendments made.. gentleman know comfortable bill inherited, would gap investigations, believe could article compliant.
amendments introduced completely change believe bill compliant, undoubtedly tested.
tested results come forward anybody actually say bill article compliant, government lawyers truly believe.
secretary state unhappy bill inherited, context amendments changes made bill.

member strangford( jim shannon) speaking irish government elements mentioned.
commission grant immunity prosecution individual provides account true best knowledge belief.
developed robust test immunity, account must tested information commission holds.
individual provide truthful account actions could passed families, participate immunity process, immunity granted would remain liable prosecution evidence exist.
prosecution takes place, conviction secured, individual eligible early release scheme northern ireland( sentences) act 1998., result amendments made house.
similarly, although acknowledge sentiment behind introducing licence conditions lords amendment 44e, respectfully suggest government sought address issues amendments adopted report place.
amendments send clear message, immunity granted, individuals convicted offences could impede reconciliation lose immunity.
government' view, approach strikes right balance providing sufficient certainty effect grant immunity necessary encourage participation ensuring appropriate consequences whose behaviour granted immunity compatible fundamental aims bill.
alternative proposed opposition would support effective information recovery process, therefore ask house joins disagreeing amendments 44d, 44e, 44f, 44g, 44h 44j.
call shadow secretary state.
may take opportunity welcome.
friend member putney( fleur anderson) front- bench team, express thanks.
