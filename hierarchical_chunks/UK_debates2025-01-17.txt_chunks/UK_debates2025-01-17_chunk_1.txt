members taken time attend today' debate, urge retain sunny disposition next hours.
happy take interventions members across house, hope.
members use throw much shade.
promise warm response regardless, hope minister provide.
today, make commitment brighter future backing sunshine bill.
future people lower household bills; less reliant dirty expensive fossil fuels, often imported abroad; country' energy supplies secure.
future vision supported voters across political divides, well industry.
get core speech, ask.
members think back short years, start energy bills crisis.
householders endured 54% rise energy price cap april 2022, bills remain 43% higher crisis.
caused widespread fuel poverty.
witnessed another shocking increase food bank use, businesses went bust, jobs lost family holiday plans cancelled.
crisis also laid bare short-
sighted past ideological decisions slow roll- renewable technologies.
imagine alternative.
imagine homes included solar power generation crisis, ongoing crisis.
bills could hundreds pounds lower everyone; householders would insulated higher bills; nation would safer stronger.
food banks would less busy, government would forced give large subsidies ensure people could get.
heart discussion pressing need tackle twin crises: cost living climate change..
members know, climate change discussion often leads debate difficult trade- offs—the government grappling good wishes so—but solar energy generation new build homes much category.
bill helps tackle cost living climate change—a clear win- win.
mcs foundation research shown payback period solar array three- bedroom semi- detached house four years, array combined technologies widely available next years.
25- year mortgage, savings stand whopping £38, 000.
solar technology also offers homeowners chance profit directly.
energy saving trust estimates typical household could make £270 £400 year.
environmental side, research solar energy shows buildings accounted 20% emissions 2023.
government placed building new homes heart agenda, support.
genuinely welcome today' second reading bill.
brought two private members' bills back benches, wish.
gentleman every success; long journey.
say impact solar panels environment green belt?
shift towards using solar panels, fear many panels installed prime agricultural land.
disappointed walsall, planning inspector given permission battery storage facility edge constituency, right conservation area.
feel strongly need look alternative places solar panels order protect communities green belt.
right.
lady entirely right.
members across house noted campaign protect rural england taken strong interest issue bill, precisely reasons describes, lot sympathy.
efficient use land space country extremely important.
achieve new home building targets government set, must ensure new build homes equipped challenges future, include climate change looking environment.
change standards new housing stock, miss economic opportunity put environment risk.
government' advisory body, climate change committee, advised meet emissions targets without “near complete decarbonisation” housing stock.
important new government, specifically secretary state energy climate change, moved conversation along, least shown answer question asked right.
gentleman christmas, said “very sympathetic” case mandatory solar panels new build homes.
right.
case updating regulations irrefutable.
regulations govern building work set building act 1984, year born, building regulations 2010, long ago members disturbed learn still large brylcreem bill days.
previous government consulted future homes standard, able respond general election.
heartening current government promised response pick work.
course strong pushback developers, default thinking profit. understand profit motive, urge developers think planet customers demanding.
pleased see bill house today, quite entranced.
member' puns, making feel completely utterly ancient.
setting aside niggle, serious point, agree important secure supply chain solar panels, eliminate use solar panels built uyghur people subject forced labour china?.
member makes reasonable point.
need clear supply chains country free slave labour.
matter government procurement rules, understand measures come house due course.
saying, understand developers' motives push back, developers know know, technology already exists implementing measures sunshine bill relatively straightforward.
solar panel technology available many years construction industry accustomed working.
mandating installation construction stage logical; removes burden homeowners, places responsibility developer.
thank.
friend bringing bill house.
important almost feels like- brainer.
many residents share frustration trying navigate process installing solar panels.
questions provider go, works, technical details.
agree bill environmental benefit, will—as started explain—take burden residents empower?
benefit lower bills without faff.. friend entirely right.
knows, bill includes recommendation set industry standard, consumers confidence buying.
burden removed homeowners responsibility placed developer, bill creates efficiency saving human resources materials.
entirely logical step take.
installing solar panels roofs houses built least 10% cheaper retrofitting.
issues around cost, members might raise interventions speeches, government estimates put cost mandatory solar panels new homes around £5, 200 per home.
sounds like lot money isolation, average cost new build final quarter 2024 far excess £400, 000, talking little% price new build home.
next nothing context monthly mortgage repayment, take figure raw form, would offset lower bills.
bill would mandate new homes built solar generation technology covering roof space—a minimum 40% equivalent building' ground- floor area.
interested solar panels mandated public buildings.
area, rednock school solar panels retrofitted.
solar panels educational facilities two effects: save money school, teach young people issue.
also area, nhs looking put solar panels south- facing roofs hospitals.
wonder could extend bill public buildings general.
take.
member' point board entirely, agree.
bill limited residential new builds; conscious public sector, cost initial installation would borne taxpayer.
right reference schools.
constituency, bournside school installing huge ground source heat pump.
national, leading case study.
right important young people understand going.
regard industry standards, need make sure industry- wide regulator certification scheme.
industry needs proper regulation give consumers confidence product.
supply chains mentioned.
give supply chains, construction industry developers time adjust, bill proposes regulations apply october 2026.
ministers may comments whether realistic timescale—they might want make longer.
sure discussion.
reasonable exemptions need apply, including tall buildings; buildings would economical install solar panels, due roof size factors; buildings forms renewable energy generation installed appropriate setting.
buildings cannot physically accommodate solar panels cover least 40% building' ground- floor area, bill requires solar panels installed maximum extent possible.
important take part myth busting.
dispel one big myth solar panels, always need clear, sunny day work; continue work overcast, cloudy conditions.
think agree good news country.
dispel another myth, solar panels installed good effect north-
facing roofs, although efficiency little lower.
overwhelming strength case measure means sunshine bill gathered support industry.
christmas, several businesses industry organisations signed open letter government declared support bill.
grateful support mcs foundation, solar energy, eco2solar,.
next ecotricity.
particularly grateful mcs foundation assistance advice technical matters last months.
thank.
member letting interrupt excellent speech, loaded fantastic puns would proud.
discussions industry making sure correct skills pipeline, enough installers people required ensure solar panels installed efficiently effectively, maximise economic benefit country?.
member absolutely right.
recall go back decade, thriving solar energy industry country.
sadly, taken steps back last years comes skills pipeline.
know issue government' agenda, welcome.
date might look, hope education colleges put courses train people, would industry work,.. member explain bill excludes use solar thermal panels?
bill focuses solar photovoltaics.
solar thermal panels different type technology covered bill.
would also like thank cpre.
right.
member aldridge- brownhills( wendy morton) spoke earlier preservation land fields green areas, cpre specifically interested perspective.
becoming increasingly worrying, starting see policy grey belt.
fear thoroughly grasp issue solar panels, battery storage renewables infrastructure go, risk green belt sudden redefined grey belt, years' time, built.
right.
lady speaks powerfully constituency, know specific issue.
mentioned housing developers, one housing developer put head parapet support bill.
grateful support thakeham, applauded supporting measure.
developers support bill sound business reasons.
clear market preference homes solar panels, relatively small proportion price rewarded decent payback, customers want.
politically, demonstrable cross- party support.
last, 79% members found supportive, suspect percentage higher new.
climate barometer tracks support mandatory solar panels new builds found clear majority support among parties' voters, would place centre political gravity.
80% conservative voters, 89% labour voters, 92% liberal democrat voters 63% reform supporters responded survey favour mandatory solar panels new build homes.
constituents rightly look make right logical decisions matters.
back measure evidence points clear benefits every level, including government' positive agenda energy climate.
mcs foundation research found mandatory solar panels.
million homes would equivalent two additional sizewell nuclear power stations, give pause thought.
country struggles build infrastructure, must look past easier, small- scale wins.
congratulate.
gentleman introducing bill.
talks nuclear power may needed solar panels houses.
view much pressure could take demand green land solar farms, many people concerns use green land, solar panels new builds?
strong suspicion market help decide answer question, inevitable produce energy sources, lower demand areas..
gentleman makes good point.
visited hinkley point school trip 11- year- old told, excitedly, new hinkley way.
regret tell house 40, current projections, hinkley expected generate power least 44.
point time, new homes built today outlast.
make work better planet, lasting testament house' efforts tackle climate change, offer protections energy shocks endured.
chance today, ministers willing support principles sunshine bill.
cannot let opportunity pass, duty build political consensus match consensus among members public.
paraphrase great morecambe wise song shares informal name given bill, let arms warm sun, let think much joy give brand new bright tomorrow—if lower people' energy bills help tackle climate change.
thank.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) introducing bill.
try cloud chamber much puns; leave.
members shower room.
[ laughter.]' painful.
glad bill brought forward.
many good things, want ensure country whole embrace future solar power generation people live, right heart communities homes.
moved past year ground level, many people constituency know frequently comment facebook.
lived adult life tower blocks, one great things 1960s council tower blocks fantastic views everybody' roofs.
decades lived tower blocks, apparent missing country.
much acreage rooftops empty devoid power generation, countries leapt ahead taken advantage.
time, seen quite worked.
watched new council housing block built right next previous place lived.
rooftops, saw solar panels go saw problems, management company local council quite able make work generate power people.
solar panels long time unused functioning.
sign technology quite mature, past five years happened.
, like, members go around constituencies, see lots solar panels houses lots conversations people pubs installed houses.
people great experience talk length reduced bills, unfortunately others tell problems challenges getting connected grid making work.
reason, reason clear eye go forward change.
hopefully, minister talk ensure policy successful future.
loads opportunities, lose sight opportunities well.
one impressive things seen constituency industrial side cluster factories around kemsley paper mill ds smith.
third cardboard produced recycled one location.
part set factories use waste products heat generate power circular carbon economy.
key part traditional forms power production.
instance, cardboard used factories cannot recycled turned electricity, carbon capture used.
carbon capture process used support work factories, production plasterboard, waste heat used.
factories already great work, want expand solar power, particularly old landfill site, perfectly placed.
great opportunity, also factory roofs.
buildings suitable, build cluster generate power locally, build homes around area provide power, solar power important part play.
much want see able change building regulations ensure meet needs opportunities factories,, time, must close eyes fact many ways ensuring reach zero- carbon future.
fixing housing crisis absolutely mutually exclusive fixing climate crisis.. member rightly identified cost living crisis climate crisis.
would add housing crisis third part, see disagree.
point made times, almost tension protecting natural environment making progress renewable energy sources.
choice two; one central.
former councillor, know vital community voices heard.
one thing upsets local communities, involved conversations matters directly impact areas live.. friend agree?
wholeheartedly agree.
gave example power generator roof working, came fact local community involved.
residents block saw benefit, causing problems, including leaks roof sorts stuff.
vital circular energy economy circular economic monetary economy people see benefits pockets well lights heating homes.
keen hear minister government plan change building regulations, meet aspirations bill ensure comprehensive strategy progress towards zero- carbon, net zero future, ensuring get way tackling local environmental problems—biodiversity on—or housing cost living crises.
things joined.
developers work deliver, ensure happens.
know implementation tricky part policy.
intention straightforward—and bill full great intentions—but getting implementation right challenge.
14 years hot cold climate policy.
sometimes previous government went hell leather tackling climate change; points, seem certain.
well developers, businesses households struggled, sure direction travel.
hopeful new government focus stability key plank growth agenda, giving developers, communities households certainty need plan together.
everyone looking framework.
areas towns face greater challenges housing housing need.
sheerness constituency, example, housing stock deteriorating quality.
much post- war council housing,, unsurprisingly coastal area, lasting high maintenance costs.
need comprehensive renewal brings better housing, opportunity leapfrog several stages environmental learning energy production, ensures energy production brought heart towns constituency.
members.. friend speaking great passion constituents—that always great hear. comes new homes, must consider efficiency top bottom.
bill add solar panels new homes—we welcome, happy support it—but must go ensuring homes efficient, warm cheap heat possible.
scotland, private member' bill introduced alex rowley msp could mean homes scotland built passivhaus standard, think gold standard right.. friend think aspire?
grateful.
friend coming point, much agree.
although constituency generally quite cold damp parts scotland, pretty cold damp, wind comes along swale get quite cold, people live north kent know.
quality housing stock, including insulation, needs attention.
mean comprehensive picture; power generation, ensuring waste power effect ultimately felt people' pockets.
know members talk greater expertise greater depth things happening constituencies opportunities see, look forward listening.
move forward, must learn past mistakes current great practice, ensure policies actually work, unlike false starts past.
congratulate.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) good fortune securing place ballot order introduce, without doubt, important bill., however, concerned scope bill, come moment, may—i propose take long.
many years, consistently opposed installation solar farms—of course, farms all—on agricultural land.
east kent, losing grade agricultural land far frequently, development used solar power generation.
completely unnecessary.
said many times, house outside, acres acres rooftops public ownership, public buildings—schools, hospitals prisons—in addition acres car park space, french would covering solar panels.
use, see need whatsoever use purposes fine agricultural land used growing crops feeding people.
think scope bill, good though may, go far enough.
must look, new build, exists done.
bye, would go stage say looking solar panels, grey water systems.
waste gallons gallons water rooftops country, course cannot soak land covered tarmac, replenishing aquifers.
water ought used flushing lavatories matters require potable water., think trick may missed.
quite clearly, going happen developers builders scream like stuck pigs.?
let take development herne bay constituency.
name developer, would hate upset taylor wimpey, avoided installing electric vehicle charging points bit wriggle room—the amount would add cost property—that allows get hook.
doubt installing solar panels initially would add first purchase price property, course might eat profit, would hate see.
essential., long past time.
notice bill gives 2026 start date; see reason whatsoever start immediately say,, every new build fitted photovoltaic panels.
another issue, design technology.
know retrofitted solar panels pretty unattractive—hideous, blunt.
surprises, day age, developing technology gone far enough fast enough develop attractive panels simply roofs like roof.
got possible develop photovoltaic tile could used listed buildings, happened.
want advise right.
member several products type referencing available market moment.. gentleman tell photovoltaic tile acceptable people enforcing regulations relating listed buildings, would delighted hear.
trying come interrupted.
kent, wonderful county, many grade ii listed buildings, present, permitted use solar panels—or solar tiles, would like see them—on listed buildings.
even permitted buildings, outbuildings, cottages whatever within curtilage listed building.
rules considerable quantity property accommodate solar panels.
king' college cambridge, one oldest prestigious heritage buildings, fine array solar panels managed get planning permission.
right.
member agree need planning terms material weight given climate change, well conservation status?
crux matter.
would allow responsible listed homes homes conservation areas energy efficiency right way.
point, agree.
lady, point.
want see fine buildings kent smothered hideous installations, find way technically making panels acceptable.
accept entirely retrofitting much harder new build.
possible inset photovoltaic panels new roof new build, much harder retrofit attractively.
would like see make much effort go road, come products acceptable across board—not new build, existing buildings.
essential bill second reading, supporting today.
flaws, committee stage, allow bill go committee.
may say.
member cheltenham, rather much wriggle room.
see canny developers finding ways exploiting exemptions, careful, written bill.
right.
friend agree unintended consequences bill could longer possible build new thatched house?
dorset hampshire, welcome people developing new thatched houses.
work bill?
bill accommodate exemptions,.
friend makes case point.
village live, thatched buildings, would like see.
may cases exemption permitted, looking bill stands, seems loopholes wide open exploitation, tightened., however, purpose committee.
let give bill second reading, get committee, amend bring back report third reading, let see become law.
one previous employers used run competition schoolchildren.
asked draw picture better future tackled climate ecological crises.
entries displayed wall close office, many times day passed looked.
many young people chosen show contrast.
one side page often burning world—now painfully familiar news feeds, dear friends california find world set alight, also reminded remember neighbours still reeling recent floods.
children' pictures sadly good predictor threat, side page, showed hope tomorrow, children often drew homes surrounded trees happy people playing outside sunshine.
without fail, rooftops houses pictures solar panels.
children understood bright sustainable future depends clean sustainable energy.
government' mission make clean energy superpower direct response climate crisis clear mission make energy secure affordable.
photovoltaics fit bill perfectly—simple, reliable effective, purest form renewable energy, converting photons directly electrical power, place power directly hands homeowners.
need embrace solar power part suite energy technologies sustainable future clear.
alongside offshore wind underpinned storage using green hydrogen, solar photovoltaic key technology decarbonise electricity sectors use cases electrify.
use land solar generation rightly contended, vast perfectly designed, yet barely tapped, resource rooftops.
residents constituency aghast mega 840 mw solar farm proposed blenheim estate,, people believe, allowed solar panels placed houses developed area..
member agree placing solar panels roofs houses much better way diversify solar panels build community consent renewable transition part government' mission?
fully agree.
many people told, intuitively, would like solar put roofs first.
think strong consensus direction.. friend member sittingbourne sheppey( kevin mckenna) talked challenges retrofitting.
need listen social science, harness new initiatives gb energy activate local authorities empower ordinary people retrofit solar.
must develop ways people easily access trusted partners help decarbonise homes save money result.
average price install solar panels post build somewhere £5, 000 £8, 000. majority people kind cash stuck back sofa.. member agree supporting bill investment environment reducing energy bills new homeowners, cash?
agree.
face transition range technologies—my professional background heat—it important put consumers heart ensure works, find ways make accessible, easy, affordable beneficial embrace new technologies.
new business models available help that—heat service, example—and need embrace.
whatever navigate transition, vital put people heart build.
worked energy sector 20 years, one comment heard, uttered, many times—more possibly count: “we putting solar every new home.- brainers politics, exist, surely one.
opportunity make crucial change, stop growing problem start solving.
putting solar power every new home save people money.
boost national renewable capacity.
crucial step mission clean energy.

sooner solar farm got permission lovely glossy leaflets next one came door next consultation, even bigger solar farm across constituency, others.
yet, heard, acres acres roof space could put solar panels.?
couple years ago, planning committee visit new housing estate built, noticed one, sometimes two, solar panel roof.

agree, advised could wanted local plan, would gone beyond national planning policy framework.
local community want, empowered.
entirely support bill, would make much sense everybody make sure new builds adequate solar panels, appropriate, alternative form green energy production, people end houses destroying climate actually afford fuel bills.
quite long time ago, remember bought first house.
carefully planned costs determine whether could afford mortgage everything else, winter came, started getting fuel bills thought, “oops, bit difficult.
