also need look distribution network operators capacity, make sure really harness energy, proposal much better large- scale solar farms plastered green belt countryside, minded support bill' second reading.
pay tribute.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) bringing forward bill subject great importance.
know personal experience time effort must taken get stage.
sure members sides house agree solar key tool renewable energy arsenal, used properly, significant positive impact tackling climate change ensuring live sustainable society.
proud represent constituency taking power solar seriously.
constituents amber valley regularly write wanting know done local national level tackle climate change.
even constituents would call eco- warriors invariably unopposed solar rooftops,, seems, unique amber valley.
walked westminster underground station morning, billboard caught eye.
msc foundation advertising fact recent yougov survey found three four voters believe solar panels mandatory new homes.
labour took control amber valley borough council 2023, council council homes whatsoever, previous conservative- run council sold housing stock 20 years earlier- market rates.
right wrong, council started new council house building programme, started small, working towards target 30 new council homes, fitted solar panels.
indeed, secretary state energy security net zero last year witnessed four new builds resulting programme visit borough alongside mayor east midlands.
fair say committed amber valley.
incorporating rooftop solar part house building programme important part delivering cleaner energy lower bills, ensuring sustainability constituents.
first became borough councillor amber valley, asked whether could planning condition solar panels must installed roofs, told possible.
totally perplexing, sure.
members imagine proud part government spearheading ambitious house building programme generation, clear commitment environmental sustainability.. lady speaks government' ambition, one simple thing could.
december 2023, lobbying developers, previous conservative government shamefully issued written ministerial statement prohibit councillor west oxfordshire district council constituency insisting higher environmental standards net zero development..
lady agree government simply revoked written ministerial statement, local councils across country would freedom set higher environmental standards?
encourage minister respond point?
would encourage minister respond, think.
however, think everything move towards better, sustainable future.
building.
million new homes, committed ambitious decarbonising agenda harnessing renewable resources across.
secretary state energy security net zero course understands importance solar part wider clean power mission, contribution energy efficiency homes make net zero emissions target.
doubt mind rooftop solar plays crucial role.
support notion behind bill.
government already working future standards, particularly technical detail solar, ensure appropriate.
ensure new homes buildings embrace energy efficiency fit net zero future, look forward government introducing standards year.

member cheltenham raising important issue house today.
people constituency passionate protecting environment, know, need produce renewable energy.
however, north east hampshire, many areas, also protective arable farming land, essential food security.
passing sunshine bill, brought house.
friend member cheltenham( max wilkinson), would challenge presumption principal way increase solar capacity solar farms large- scale industrial solar power generation.
prioritising solar panelling new homes allow create right energy mix produce energy sustainable way., help address challenges economic growth.
reducing energy bills, especially social housing lower incomes, essential part tackling recent cost living crisis, developing industry innovation course good jobs.
lot conversation morning benefit homeowners installing solar panels new builds.
solar panels included new social housing, would also helping face greatest challenge paying energy bills, gone since energy price cap rise.
added benefit cost living crisis.. friend course correct.
cost savings afford installation first place.
north east hampshire, fantastic examples community investment renewables.
hart district council installed 121 photovoltaic panels roof offices, generating much 57, 000 kwh electricity per year, enough power around 20 average homes every year.
hart leisure centre seen £200, 000 investment solar panelling sports hall, reduces demand put energy grid result heating swimming pool.
permit “sliding doors” moment, madam, house built 1961, technology around.
solar panels today' quality installed, would energy bills significantly lower, could saved region 800 tonnes carbon—roughly equivalent 140 london sydney return flights.
given government' ambitious house building targets, retrofitting expensive installing build stage, makes sense ensure right protect environment, reduce energy bills secure industry future.
house built without renewable energy missed opportunity save carbon money, grow economy.
furthermore, house built without solar panels increases pressure put panels elsewhere, including fields.
sustainable energy development critical, north east hampshire, elsewhere, want come cost countryside agricultural land.
support bill, prioritises putting solar panels roofs new homes.
important debate; solar, climate environment.
matters, generation constituents.
constituency mailbag full ideas get clean energy messages advocating solar panels, know constituents interested debate.
many experts constituency.
yesterday, sat nuclear scientist wirral west, many people passionate environment.
one quite brilliant architect, colin usher, combine expertise passion.
brought intelligent design bear order build super low energy use homes.
along triple glazing, insulation intelligent design, solar panels play important part homes.

brilliant design winter months, one people living homes pays £10 energy.
hope expect future homes meet high standard.
welcome fact government already made commitment developing next generation homes high energy standards efficiency.
better pocket planet.
labour clear crisis climate nature needs serious action., election, committed tripling solar power 2030.
solar energy important role, part gb energy, supports mission make country clean energy superpower.
meeting pledges action: approving solar projects power equivalent almost 400, 000 homes.
note government, one week, consented solar last government installed entire year.
shows marked difference government already making area whole house clearly passionate.
pleased minister developing strong new standards, combine labour' ambition build high- quality homes right places ambition protect environment.
commitment action bring lower bills constituents.
sorely needed difficult cost living crisis, lasting years, put pressure household bills.

must meet ambition greener, sunnier secure future.
thank.
friend member cheltenham( max wilkinson) bringing bill house.
environmental campaigner past 22 years, much support bill, including climate nature bill—a shameless plug—that encourages shift away fossil fuels.
however, support every measure increases use renewables, sunshine bill important.
good ways less good ways meet international commitments carbon emissions climate change.
less good way, already mentioned many.
members, cover large tracts countryside solar panels without agreement co- operation local communities.
welcome bill, choice solar farms rooftop solar installations zero- sum game; distinct role play.
ambitious plans, solar farms would account

government' housing targets mean area needs, 500 new homes next 20 years, thousands constituents worried.
many would far happier knew properties built would meet needs local people, affordable buy cheap run..
friend agree new homes( solar generation)
bill-

wholeheartedly agree.
friend.
also need increase national food security, decreasing reliance vulnerable international food supply chains depending home- grown food, grown trusted standards.
farmers want grow food, solar panels.
need national land use framework becoming ever pressing.
need sensible long- term strategy use finite resource land space country.
would like see much greater emphasis multipurposing land area.
need get away dividing food production, housing electricity generation.
make much better use land take multilayered approach.
end, makes sense prioritise rooftop solar ahead greenfield sites.
60% solar targets could delivered rooftops 2035.
generating energy source reduces strain national grid, improves overall energy resilience reduces need long, wasteful grid connections generating energy source reduces strain national grid, improves overall energy resilience reduces need long, wasteful grid connections ranks electricity pylons marching across countryside.
retrofitting solar panels houses costly disruptive; much efficient effective install solar time building.
europe, get.
eu solar standard requires solar panels new existing public, commercial residential buildings.
eu' goal increase use renewable energy reduce dependence russian fossil fuels, working., sunshine bill win- win- win.
win, reducing need imported energy sources improving resilience self- reliance; win householders, reduce energy bills generating electricity; win planet, supporting transition away fossil fuels.
wholeheartedly support sunshine bill.
thank.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) bringing forward bill, deals issue matters deeply constituents.
winter seen devastating impact climate change communities, colleagues watched horror wildfires spread california flooding impacted constituency many areas across., ever, must find ways weave pursuit clean, home- grown energy everything, solar power make vital contribution.
pleasure visiting many local schools kettering since elected.
every visit, children told worried local environment future world, feel worries.
proud stand manifesto promised make clean energy superpower, pledged double onshore wind, triple solar power quadruple offshore wind 2030.
even prouder see progress labour government already made delivering pledges.
two weeks election,, including, still know way chamber portcullis house, secretary state lifted ban onshore wind, established 2030 mission control centre consented solar projects generate.
gw—enough power almost 400, 000 homes.
clearly government delivery, working drive forward increase rooftop solar,, appropriate, help accommodate government' 2030 clean power mission.
potential rooftop solar huge, especially constituencies mine, one fastest- growing areas, course, sun always shines.
contacted many constituents issue, support government' aim achieve 95% clean energy 2030.
understand desire solar need new builds, warehouses ground, glad government committed ensuring local communities continue voice planning matters, communities hosting clean energy infrastructure benefit.
speed house building kettering means strangers irresponsible difficult developers, commitments environment must go hand hand planning.
know government introduce standards house building year ensure new homes buildings fit net zero future, also need ensure developers cannot shirk responsibilities environment local residents.
house building needs sustainable local people trust needs, needs environment, met.
government' national planning policy framework lesson deliver biggest boost social affordable housing generation unlocking green energy recognising benefits best agricultural land, making vital commitments use planning enhance natural local environment, protect valued landscapes, recognise character beauty countryside.
grateful opportunity put record support rooftop solar government' commitment environment kettering beyond..
5° global temperature limit passed first time ever 2024.
politically significant milestone stark reminder must leave stone unturned make systemic changes required every part economy safe future.
rooftop solar one easiest changes make.. member south cotswolds( dr savage) said, “win- win- win” policy helps cut people' bills climate emissions, helps strengthen energy security.
research development rooftop solar already british success story—we world leaders—so time take next step maximise deployment- site solar generation new builds.
aim sunshine bill, pleased co- sponsored proposal create new jobs, drive innovation yet, generate abundant amounts energy sun shines,.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) pointed,.
making solar panels mandatory suitable new homes almost universally popular—other major house builders.
want focus short time available.
solar energy estimates, 15 gw solar power capacity currently place, around two thirds ground remainder residential commercial roofs.
meet government' targets ramp solar capacity—which hope do—we looking.
80% buildings 2050 already built, must work hard retrofit renewables, remaining 20% still built.
goodness' sake, let' build right first time.
private housing developers come mix.
british designer “grand designs” presenter kevin mccloud wrote last year 15 years' time average profit new build home rocketed £6, 000 £63, 000.
call ministers stand major house builders ensure pay cost putting solar every suitable new roof.
organisation 100% renewable calculated mandatory solar panels heat pumps new homes would add around £8, 000 cost new home—an amount decreases installations gather speed.
clearly, housing developers afford cost, neither anyone else afford consequences meeting solar climate targets.
los angeles wildfires track among costliest history, well heartbreaking, losses already expected exceed £109.
billion.
failing decarbonise speed, line climate science, dwarf cost future- proofing homes.
moral case acting unequivocal, economic one.
ministers worried risk solar costs passed homebuyers, government could simply stop happening.
could also offer interest- free loans technology, make easier retail lenders drive rooftop deployments.
property- linked finance green mortgages help consumers capital costs installation, could regulation incentivise low interest rates green mortgages.
political choices government could make.
sunshine bill solar panels about—forgive me—shining sunlight power.
making every home mini power station would help rebalance power towards communities.
therefore much hope government today choose back solar rooftop revolution mandatory solar included future homes standard, rather choosing protect vested interests behind vast ultimately unsustainable house builders' profits.
thank.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) introducing bill.
think laudable, heart much right place.
think climate crisis matters policy might contribute government' goal making clean energy superpower.
government, guided excellent work secretary state energy security net zero, already making great strides combating climate crisis, putting green energy heart country' future supporting green industrial growth wherever.
government established great british energy, means need new green infrastructure sooner rather later.
comes specifically solar energy, pleased, within days taking office, government approved three major, long- stalled, large solar farms lincolnshire east anglia, capable generating.
gw, enough power 500, 000 homes.
clear statement intent, one proud.
time, secretary state pledged rooftop revolution, making easier newly built homes come solar panels install solar panels existing homes.
third solar generation capacity already comes rooftop solar, important part energy generation mix know government fully believe rooftop solar,.. member talks lot measures put forward move towards net zero, need go.
cpre hertfordshire says 60% targets could achieved rooftop solar panels alone, supporting bill help make sure revolution helps towards net zero planet people.
thank.
member intervention, cover points shortly.
broadly agree sentiment said.
bill' aims, promoting installation solar panels new homes, feed government' overall intent, pleased.
note, however, undeniable solar farms, especially larger ones, much efficient rooftop solar whole spectrum reasons.
rooftop solar panels constrained size, orientation structural limitations individual buildings, solar farms optimised maximum energy generation.
difference output high 30%.
economies scale mean cost install, maintain centralise supportive infrastructure notably reduces ratio cost per unit energy generated solar farms.
say support rooftop solar, much, solar farms highly scalable, cost-
effective means achieve green energy transition.
exactly point—we need, creates subsidy opportunities rooftop solar panels?
completely agree.
one solution versus another, diverse, broad array solutions, feeding grand, greener future.. gentleman talks balance. view solar better rooftops, pro- solar installations, many thousand acres constituency actively campaigning see turned ground- mounted solar?
must say declare support projects wherever come.
indeed, touch moment.
recently asked media whether would happy pylons outside house, responded photograph pylon taken window house.
long felt despite great benefits solar farms bring, often difficult bring forward.
around 15 gw solar energy generation capacity.
germany, meanwhile, solar capacity grew 14 gw 2023 alone.
clear' current planning regime approach building infrastructure constrains growth sees lag behind similar nations.
want clean energy superpower,, leading green energy revolution rather following, must tear barriers growth unlock potential.
constituency, labour colleagues erewash borough council, small, local way, helped part change need.
since taking control council 2023, approved several solar farms, previous conservative administration always blocked, proud colleagues.
also proud tell energy secretary information visited erewash time last year.
progression vital infrastructure projects, pivotal future country, must driven national strategy held bureaucracy.
said, bill' proposals laudable.
drive green energy generation along government' ambition make clean energy superpower could, decade come, race space 1950s 1960s—countries engaged great contest scientific innovation progress.
nothing, former research scientist, could welcome government pursuing science, innovation technology matter core policy, national pride.
government committed greatly expanding provision solar energy generation acknowledged many times significant part rooftop solar play expansion.
hope supporters bill assured government' genuine commitment front.
climate crisis housing crisis profound issues, worthy descriptor “crisis” need immediate action.
know many right.. members share government' commitment act, certainly.
pay tribute neighbour.
friend member cheltenham( max wilkinson) boldly taking cause.- named sunshine bill, mind reflects disposition brightly—as though glowing cranium—[ laughter.

friend member cheltenham brought consistently doorsteps across tewkesbury constituency recent years.
widely considered blindingly obvious antidote rising energy bills phasing fossil fuels, people tended ask, exasperated tone, earth new homes built solar panels mandate.. friend described, public roundly support measures, one poll registering 70% support.
whether new homes( solar generation) bill goes vote today, hope government recognise alignment environmental pledges take ball run.

grey day, also thank bringing sunshine.
pleased government already exploring rooftop solar panels new build houses “clean power 2030” action plan, aims least 95% great' electricity produced clean energy 2030.
government relaunched solar taskforce quickly general election, bringing together experts government industry.
taskforce' road map due published spring, set recommendations triple' solar capacity 2030.
look forward.
pylon issue brought.
grew lived home pylon nearly 50 years, think done harm.
know government due introduce standards later year.
set new homes buildings path away reliance volatile fossil fuels, ensure homes buildings fit net zero future.
sure minister expand.
well new builds, important people know assistance packages help installing solar panels existing homes.
includes energy company obligation, warm homes local grant warm homes social housing fund.
owners solar panels also paid surplus electricity solar panels generate smart export guarantee, zero rate vat residential solar panels.
much covered debate devolved, although members may known welsh.
constituents gower across wales, point welsh government' nest programme, provide free energy efficiency improvements, including solar panels, eligible.
bill “extends england wales.
course,.
member cheltenham aware building regulations devolved.
conversations welsh government members senedd?
sure welsh labour government would delighted work alongside labour government—they probably already so—to ensure homes energy efficient constituents opportunity save money bills.
important thing path forward government work house builders get best outcomes environmental targets housing targets.
must also build high- quality, sustainable affordable homes.
mentioned many, scope bill cover roofs new builds, highlight need solar panels roofs.
right.
member herne bay sandwich( roger gale) said, must take agricultural land need food feed country consideration, must strike fair right balance.

madam, beaming.
south cambridgeshire one fastest growing constituencies country terms house building lab space.
people constantly say, “why new homes without solar panels roofs?
“why new homes one two solar panels part roofs?
sadly, 2025, developers still required meet—not exceed—the merton rule' inadequate 10% energy improvement standard.
liberal democrat councillors constituency pushing hard change local level.
fact, five years since took control council, south cambridgeshire rapidly become district highest number solar panels fitted fastest increase planning applications include solar panels.
lack ambition political national level held back revolution solar rooftops.
still building homes cold damp skyrocketing energy bills.
former conservative government disgracefully scrapped zero carbon homes policy, dithered delayed future homes standard.
earlier,.
member waveney valley( adrian ramsay) lamented—in good faith—the drawdown environmental pledges 2016.
course, coalition government; saw got happens liberal democrats longer hold people account.
surprise anyone hear agree wholeheartedly.
record corrected.
vital bill helps repair damage, look forward minister' commitment bringing changes.
mentioned, lack ambition solar rooftop revolution contributed barrier public acceptance larger scale solar farms.
hearing people say, “why put panels rooftops homes, industrial sites commercial warehouses first?
need joined- plan; need government urgently bring forward much- promised land use framework national energy system operator' strategic spatial energy plan, show much solar farm energy still needed would best placed.
way, meet needs.
