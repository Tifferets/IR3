thank secretary state advance sight statement.
today' statement tells several stories government.
tells story priorities: universities,?
tells story analysis: think wrong think.
tells story competence: changes, regulator used different approach long?
tells story prejudice, continue reinforce binary choice young people: either academic vocational, university apprenticeship., tells story values—about choice put caps aspirations ambitions young people; ministers opportunity children, people' children; government whose big idea world- leading universities put fresh barriers opportunity, anxious keep young people place.
tells everything need know tories priority young people.
tories' priority middle urgent crisis country; families struggling make ends meet; patients facing biggest waiting lists nhs history; children going school buildings ministers acknowledge “very likely” collapse; spiral low productivity, low growth, low wages tories holding back.
prime minister weak hock back benchers seeing action important priorities.
instead, 13 years power, government shown really think universities, famous across world, core many regional economies essential pandemic response: public good, political battleground.
government' concept successful university course, based earnings, narrow limiting.
ask secretary state briefly consider case right.
member richmond( yorks)( rishi sunak).
prime minister degree politics one leading universities, yet government lost control almost 50 councils year, second choice party, track fail deliver pledges set publicly.
secretary state believe prime minister' degree sense high- value course?
let clear today' announcement really.
many successful newer universities—the fruits determination successive governments, labour conservative, spread opportunity country—often draw students local communities.
many areas far london, far existing concentrations graduate jobs.
many students come backgrounds family,, chance go university.
many young people benefit extra support arrive university ensure succeed.
labour benches welcome success universities widening participation welcoming young people higher education, yet today, secretary state telling young people—including excited finishing studies year—that government believe hard work counts nothing.
secretary state absolutely clear house, tell universities' courses considers low value?
secretary state keen trumpet party' record apprenticeships, let set government' record really.
since 2015- 16, apprenticeship starts among- 19s dropped 41%, apprentice achievements age group 57%.
since secretary state entered place, number young people achieving apprenticeship level halved, failing generation young people desperate take apprenticeship.
lastly importantly, values government set today clear: conservatives saying england' young people opportunity choice.
bizarre irony conservative government seeking restrict freedom restrict choices seems entirely lost.
labour shatter class ceiling.
ensure young people believe opportunity.
labour party opportunity, aspiration freedom.
let clear,, young people want go university merely get financially, chance join pursuit learning, explore ideas undertake research benefits.
chance opportunity matter.
children deserve better.
deserve government whose important mission break barriers opportunity build country background barrier.
deserve labour government.
