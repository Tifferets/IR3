gentleman' observations.
may like look canadian scheme, reasonable exemplar, although circumstances different.
awarded 110 million canadian dollars, morning canadian dollar worth 58p, scheme covered much broader scope population canada smaller.
covered police, armed forces civil servants, scope much wider.
although two directly comparable, canadian scheme least make feel right ballpark.
afraid cannot give.
gentleman commitment seeking, urge look closely schemes certainly canadian one, probably closest comparator.
may impress minister importance hearing lgbt veterans' voices floor house, important hear apology prime minister time?,, want share concerns structure scheme minister talked.
referred front door; assurance front door remain open long needed?
many lgbt veterans suffer great trauma shame, quite far away front door.
need support trusted partners fighting pride get anywhere near.
yes, front door remain open, stakeholder pack also sent organisations know interested, urging socialise, vital.
cannot emphasise enough vital believe eligible restorative action—in first instance, non- financial—should register interest., able register flag fact may interested financial award well.
unless data, think job determining scheme ultimately looks like difficult, sooner get handle, sooner start get money door.
issue raised many times five years armed forces spokesperson snp, much welcome lord etherton' review, pay tribute caroline craig fighting pride.
mentioned spurious reasons many lgbt veterans dismissed.
course, thing colleagues served encouraged report supposed misdemeanours.
think one difficulties government tracking affected impacted, records.
sure must things people' records tied well.
want mention £50 million.
done quick sum,, 120 people responded got share, would £44, 000, absolute pittance lost career, lost pension, loss earnings loss reference go new career outside armed forces.
really look £50 million figure, even touch surface.
