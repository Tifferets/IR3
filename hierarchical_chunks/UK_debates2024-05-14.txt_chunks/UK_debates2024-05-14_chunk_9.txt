understandably struggling keep never- ending stream immigration legislation flowing government, illegal migration act second three bills, one goal mind—sending asylum seekers rwanda—and completely failing terms.
shambles start finish.
meanwhile, labour benches clear problem face: large numbers desperate asylum seekers crossing continents, exploited criminal smuggling gangs operate routes across english channel, met incompetent clueless conservative government lost control borders addicted headline- chasing gimmicks.

opposition front benchers' scant alternative tackling illegal migration, shadow minister today proffered house, tell already doubled national crime agency funding immigration crime.
already thousands officials working matter migration borders directorate.
practice, policy means migrant amnesty, letting thousands illegal migrants,, stay indefinitely.
would end rwanda scheme—the leader opposition clear would end, come may—but already working deterring people making crossings.
opposition would allow tens thousands claims lodged outside, undoing progress made addressing asylum backlog.
would also deal european union—one stop boats—taking 100, 000 asylum seekers every year eu countries.
