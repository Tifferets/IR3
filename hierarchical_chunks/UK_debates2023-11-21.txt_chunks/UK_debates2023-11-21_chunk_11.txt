however, honest conversation heading, need frank assessment.
mindless vandalism decision take one respected, influential contributions world—the partnerships, thought leadership innovation—and trash lot deflect domestic crisis.
former prime minister, shamed young footballer abandoning decision allow children go hungry pandemic, pulled rug poorest people poorest countries.

finally, minister discussed central importance women girls many times.
among biggest losers decisions recent decades.
empowering biggest untapped driver growth global economy, way meeting sustainable development goals without closing shameful gap. must run like thread whole agenda—not addition, pages document.
