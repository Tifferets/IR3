( urgent question): ask secretary state energy security net zero make statement implications offshore wind contracts difference allocation round.
first annual contracts difference auction—the first ever done—was completed last week delivered total.
gw renewable electricity, contracts going record number projects.
auction delivered significant quantities new solar onshore wind generation, well supporting 11 new tidal stream projects, first time, geothermal projects.
competitive auction, set backdrop highly challenging macroeconomic conditions impacted sector globally.
given first annual round, expected would lower capacity previous biennial rounds,, last year' round first three years, higher annual element record round.
government remain committed offshore floating offshore wind projects, round provides valuable learning subsequent auctions.
work already started allocation round, incorporating results recent round, look forward strong pipeline technologies able participate.
move annual auctions means allocation round open six months' time, march 2024, means could minimal indeed delay deployment new capacity round.
government also remain committed target decarbonising power system 2035 ambitions 50 gw offshore wind, including gw floating offshore wind.
trajectory meeting aims, well legally binding carbon budget targets, linear.
outcome one technology one auction prevent reaching goals.
load nonsense.
wonder secretary state hiding.
auction energy security disaster, act economic self- harm part government.
new offshore wind projects means families' energy bills £2 billion higher energy security weakened.
worst, totally avoidable.
ministers warned impacts higher inflation—in letter renewableuk march, july—and offshore wind much cheaper gas could raised price auction would still saved billions pounds families, refused listen.
first, minister tell government ignored repeated warnings?
secondly, said friday every country boat, wrong.
ireland listened industry adjusted price, successful auction march 2023.
government learn lesson?
thirdly, terrible truth episode reveals much deeper flaw approach?
month month summer, claimed answer energy crisis oil gas, result.
dependent expensive, insecure fossil fuels.
exposed whims petrostates dictators.
every wind farm fail build makes exposed dictators like putin, knows.
bills higher, security worse, jobs lost, climate failure—the government trashed offshore wind, crown jewels energy system, raising bills, trashed onshore wind banning, raising bills, trashed home insulation, raising bills.
seen 13 years failed energy policy, fiasco shows conservatives, quite simply, party unfit govern.
pleased see day rumours right.
gentleman longer position true.
perhaps understandable context passionate highly successful round seen.
gw annualised basis.
think record round.
member previous labour government left country.% electricity coming renewables.
first quarter year, 48% electricity renewables.
government, contracts difference system, transformed economics offshore wind.

gw offshore wind pipeline—more enough.. 5—[ interruption.]
right.
gentleman understandably, given weakness arguments, wants heckle times, knowing easy dismantle.
asks capacity, tell.
gw currently construction.
ever, right.
gentleman fails side consumers.
moved annualised auction precisely ensure could learn lessons round, add industry insight ensure could move forward.
projects take multiple years developed, none disappeared.
predict, moving triumph.
gw renewables, came successfully friday, allocation round successful still.
continue build reputation country cut emissions major economy transformed electricity generation.
mentioned insulation—how gall, know. moved 14% homes properly insulated left power 50% end year.
thank minister engagement process, particularly new technology floating offshore wind.
three floating offshore wind projects due bid allocation round none, due low administrative strike price.

thanks efforts.
friend, know support across house.
call scottish national party spokesperson.
minister failed point.
gw scarcely half achieved auction round.
also failed mention, heralding onshore wind, 90% found scotland.
since 2014, four auction rounds yielded gw,.
gw, gw gw, nil return utter catastrophe.
critical need massive investment offshore patently obvious bills climate, yet ambition thwarted incompetent previous secretary state treasury, knows price everything value nothing.
minister assure department get round table industry matter urgency try repair damage?
industry needs strike price reflects- mutually- exclusive goals lower bills, net zero, jobs investment scotland elsewhere.
confirm whether recovery group auction round convened secretary state try get catastrophe resolved??.
gentleman party never fail trash country—[ interruption.]
heckle wishes.
meeting industry representatives afternoon, said, announcing two months' time price ceiling next round—[ interruption.]
getting heckling, least majesty' opposition, left parlous situation.
world leader many technologies going continue.. member angus( dave doogan) recognise need attract investment country talk, might find scottish jobs would even stronger pipeline already., much completed wind capacity still requires connection national grid?
wind capacity constructed, normally connected grid.
connected grid need connected grid.
call chair select committee energy security net zero.
boom bust fiasco inevitably knock- ons supply chain.
concerned minister?
also, concerned projects built cfd securities invoked contracts literally raking windfall act?
quite follow second part.
gentleman' question, happy write topic.
west somerset, minister knows, ideal offshore wind.
interested know people bid round.
reasons?
government learn lessons round people like.
friend member north devon( selaine saxby) make sure people bidding next round?
typically set key auction parameters november, include ceiling pay particular technologies.
based analysis supply chain costs, also commission external analysis.
important data comes individual auction rounds, basis set price parameters.
industry warned, every year, wants pay.
always make judgment call making sure minimise—[ interruption.]
would much easier give answer,, right.
member doncaster north( edward miliband) would stop— order.
think, man always happy heckle back benches, minister deserves little bit.
set prices, immediately learn auction.
one reasons annual auction quickly adjust, said, projects come next round minimal delay.
wind farm brighton probably become iconic pier, reality government' failure delay construction beautiful installations around coast.
failure also failure market- based private investment system government determined pursue, rather publicly owned co- ordinated building programme work alongside private investment longer failure nobody bids?
thank.
gentleman revealing true face labour party going.
go back days hardly renewables, allow great british energy, whatever labour going call creature, squeeze private investment destroy successful renewables market europe, destroy government' progress tackling parlous position left behind right.
member doncaster north friends.
continue world leader cutting emissions, move state- run, left- wing obsessions colleagues like.
member brighton, kemptown( lloyd russell- moyle).
offshore wind plays, continue play, key strategic role enhancing energy security, achieving net zero revitalising coastal communities lowestoft.
get back track, right.
friend confirm criteria applying round take account current economic realities, appropriate fiscal measures considered ahead autumn statement specific focus given enhancing local supply chains?
thank.
friend, consistent champion power renewables meet environmental challenges economic benefits come.
absolutely right nature cfd system learns previous auction round, real data, uses learning inform next round.
confident, success.
gw friday, ar6 promises successful still.
congratulate minister turning complacency chutzpah new art form.
ineptitude tory ministers means latest cfd round saw smallest auction return since 2015—a failing entirely avoidable.
ensure delivers 35 gw new offshore wind capacity needed six years?
ministers yet fail heed warnings industry experts advance?
set parameters based best information.
say, one reason moving annual round allow quickly learn lessons round.
get wind occasion, regret, put real- world prices learnings next round.
system, always trying make sure get parameters right balance need generate additional green energy cost taxpayer.
understandably, given carelessness public finances consumers, opposition seem care.
job balance, ensuring get generation, 77 gw pipeline.
position track meet ambitions, lead europe—not would know listen.
lady.
thank minister including geothermal projects allocation round, welcome.
however, echo everything.
friend member north devon( selaine saxby) says celtic sea projects.
differently round?
advice would give supply chains, specifically ports, trying submit applications flowmis—floating offshore wind manufacturing investment scheme—funding?
conversations grid capacity, ensure eventually runs smoothly?
ever,.
friend well- informed.
working fronts.
flowmis applications closed two weeks ago, working flat analyse.
hope end year shortlisted primary list schemes move forward due diligence, take forward floating wind deployment, supply chain south- west, wales, scotland around rest.
working fronts determined.
rightly highlights, seeing first geothermal projects come cfd fantastic, 11 tidal projects.
pay tribute colleagues worked hard promote tidal energy make sure continue world leader well.
embarrassment government shows falling behind race green jobs internationally.
lowest growth industries among eight biggest economies.
government focusing much broadening increasing capacity offshore wind, rather listening industry making fatal errors?
labour party nationalising creating state- owned behemoth, wants hurl money direction business.
judgment balance things pleased say successful; largest offshore wind sector europe.
country government, cfds, transformed economics situation inherited right.
member doncaster north colleagues power.
delivering floating offshore wind project celtic sea vital energy security decarbonisation.
minister agree need bolster confidence emerging industry?
two things.
agree successful allocation flowmis money south wales ports order get industry moving vital?
also agree need ensure crown estate' leasing round end year done successfully, gw visibility, order send strong market signal industry invest?
right.
friend also someone, thick thin, promotes industry sees opportunity offers wales.
makes special bid welsh ports, would expect, understand make comment.
entirely agree importance crown estate round.
suffice say across government working flat, colleagues' support, support crown estate ensure maximise opportunity celtic sea.
government' obsession oil gas left mess.
department prioritised new oil gas licences support wind power, flies face climate change commitments responsibilities citizens—our constituents—to keep energy prices low.
oil gas always expensive wind energy.
minister fill gap gw offshore wind missed, would saved consumers £2 billion year?
talking sixth auction round—i talking fifth one, missed.. lady completely mistaken.
working flat reduce demand fossil fuels country build renewables.
would hope would celebrate fact largest offshore wind sector europe.
government long warned focus cfds primary mechanism financing new renewables risks undermining investor confidence infrastructure assets long lifespans significant- front capital costs, nuclear tidal range generation.
following government' decision employ regulated asset base model support development new nuclear, minister commit looking urgently optimum financial model new tidal range projects, could make crucial contribution future energy mix?
cfd scheme among successful, successful, sort world.
always look ways improve.
looking bringing non- price factors finesse, opposition party' idea state- run enterprise, squeezing private investment, would destroy opportunities going forward.
need least another £100 billion invested 2030 labour party ever threaten come power, would put risk.
teesside, promised thousands jobs offshore wind industry, investors getting little nervous direct result government failures provide right business environment.
minister get business environment right deliver jobs promised, put jeopardy government failures?
getting balance right continue.
making sure look consumer always guiding light, balance getting generation need.
seen companies seah investing teesside sumitomo looking investing scotland— getting nervous—. gentleman decries talks area nation, tells investors getting nervous.
champion successes instead decrying, might find would give investors even confidence still.
agree policy minister pursues.
net zero policy disastrous costly terms electricity prices future planning.
however, feel sympathy today.
criticised highlighted high energy prices offering inflated prices wind industry, claims producing wind energy getting cheaper course wants higher prices.
offered, would bid auction.
real reason first time refused allow bid walk away cfd agreements, price electricity whatever price want therefore inflated profits?
indicate wind industry knows cannot produce electricity cheaply wants system balanced favour?
right.
gentleman see eye eye net zero economic benefits wind industry.
offer cost- effectiveness.
amazing see scaled, able bring price.
obvious went north sea would able bring price crashing, yet country led world.
looks numbers, hope find whole house agree one thing: offshore wind economic way producing energy, one support.
last week, think- tank common wealth made critical point: “reliance market coordination leaves transition vulnerable demands private capital”.
abundantly clear private capital cannot deliver urgently required stem climate crisis.
wales, welsh government know,, summer, launched community- owned renewable energy company, ynni cymru.
minister agree required, action taking address?
thank.
lady pulling back veil labour' real policy, hates private capital, hates private investment would destroy phenomenal success country generating.[ interruption.]
front benchers heckle like, back benchers want.
policy threatens british people threatens path net zero.
must make sure people.
lady never power country.
scottish renewables said results major blow renewables sector scotland serve indication urgent reform needed.
scottish renewables, political party part industry, also said disastrous results bad scotland' energy supply chain, desperately needs steady stream projects make investments skilling new technology.
minister acknowledge department' failure listen warnings industry holding back scotland' renewable sector?
thank.
learned lady question.
industry always asks paid money.
job make right judgment call getting balance right.
saw newspapers yesterday astronomers discovered water- covered planet far away galaxy.
disappoint excited scientists, answers today, minister appears got.
[ interruption.]
another planet, yes.
seriously though, setback erebus project south- west wales deeply disappointing.
first kind wales supposed pave way developing industry.
hope minister reassure taking steps make sure, ar6, projects erebus enabled compete successfully lead way industry wales.
thank.
gentleman, least attempt gag.
tell says whole basis system—that learns round.
real economic data get auction round.
moving annual rounds, ebb flow right balance sought getting generation require, set extremely ambitious deadlines, paying much.
balance strike.. gw imagine even better next time.
feel almost taking life hands, want commend minister one small piece good news round, relation development marine renewables.
success auction tidal stream development illustrates would possible wave power given opportunity ar6.
tidal stream, minister agree needed gw target deployment?
work people house interest marine renewables sector deliver ahead ar6?
may pay tribute right.
gentleman?
met constituency visited european marine energy centre saw projects water.
personally determined ensure tidal stream continues grow.
maintain global leadership, high percentage supply chain positive.
tempts get ahead policy, cannot.
however, dedicated pot year strengthen get position might realistic policy position take.
even higher price, offshore wind would help slash bills.
minister saw irish government recognise inflation, price proceed successful auction, discussions industry treasury colleagues price set?
thank.
lady question, good one.
obviously, look whether intervention, given prices continue change set, right thing.
think cfd mechanism—the way operated—is sound best thing allow pass year.
one reason annual auction precisely allow quickly adjust,, say, soon november, setting parameters next year.
last november, government paid £700 million china general nuclear corporation buy china' state- owned nuclear power enterprise sizewell, spent best part 2022 freeing reliance russian oil gas.
given failure government sell offshore wind projects latest round, minister please comment energy independence authoritarian served inability run auction?
running auctions every year, every year, seeking get generation require lowest possible cost consumer.
make apology.
fact successful system, europe, globally, something applauded recognised.
windsor report last month provides sobering analysis scale new electricity transmission infrastructure required serve increased renewable generation consumer demand short space time.
however, report finds, considerable resistance locally pylon development, finding constituency.
competence development welsh government, minister pull together working group ministers across experts consider windsor report, particular advantages cable ploughing technology, would underground cables comparable cost overhead pylons without visual damage?
thank.
gentleman constructive effective question.
absolutely right highlight challenges making sure right transmission connection infrastructure facilitate offshore wind.
way
minimises negative impacts communities, rewards hosting, looks new technologies innovations, areas, order facilitate effective connection minimal negative impact communities host.
light disappointing results cfd ar5 auction given always trying constructive contributions house, government revisit exclusion northern ireland renewable projects scheme, especially light significant increase onshore wind tidal stream projects supported ar5?
northern ireland perfectly positioned onshore wind tidal stream make major contribution energy security net zero ar6 beyond.
minister commit enable northern ireland part ar6?
suggest.
gentleman colleagues need commit facilitating northern ireland.
energy devolved get devolved assembly running.
get devolved government going northern ireland, unleash opportunities.
department, responsible energy northern ireland.
completes urgent question.
point order,.
st leonard' constituency one schools affected reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.
last week, received ministerial statement secretary state education,, week, despite raac still issue, heard nothing secretary state minister.
