friend member bradford west( naz shah) —another outstanding member committee—states: “a person would otherwise meet requirements subsection() shall considered meet requirements solely result voluntarily stopping eating drinking.
suspect amendment put forward result lengthy discussions committee regarding whether people anorexia would eligible assisted death bill.
previous career becoming mp, worked number people eating disorders.
aware hugely sensitive complex issues surrounding disordered eating, particularly anorexia.
also know personal issue number colleagues across house, result experiences.
eating disorders cause huge distress individuals, families loved ones, care right treatment, possible people recover go back leading full fulfilling life.. lady absolutely right matter eating disorders, understanding amendment relates effectively starve position becoming terminally ill without eating disorder—that thrust amendment.
see, intend respond?.
gentleman makes important point.
amendment specifically eating disorders; broader context.
come later.
experience mind—my personal experience spoken many colleagues issue—that say, said committee, bill stands, anorexia would qualify person eligible assisted death.
bill clear person cannot considered terminally ill basis mental disorder.
clause makes clear person must inevitably progressive illness disease cannot reversed treatment.
anorexia serious mental health condition inevitably progressive, thankfully, reversed treatment.
course, every stage assisted dying process patient must found capacity make decision, checked repeatedly throughout process.
someone severe anorexia would highly unlikely assessed capacity make decision assisted dying.
tragic reality patient ill result eating drinking whatever reason, would die process assisted dying able take place, could take two months complete stages process set bill, latest clinical guidance general range survival voluntary stopping eating drinking begun seven 21 days.
stopping eating drinking also leads range symptoms would make meaningful conversations, required bill, impossible.
said, know people expressed concerns severe physical consequences decision stop eating drinking could still enable someone claim eligibility assisted dying would otherwise able, believe motivation behind amendment 14.
rose— take one final intervention.. lady kind.

set, think risk negligible.
taken advice, concern clinicians might difficulty assessing certainty decision stop eating eating reason person' terminal prognosis;, drafting changes may required place amendment pass.
mind, however, ensure sort loophole, matter small reality one, happy support amendment today.
rose— going leave, may.
conscious many colleagues wish speak important debate, keen hear contributions, conclude remarks.
thank colleagues listening, hope able support amendments name today interests strengthening workability bill providing greater flexibility safeguards patients professionals.
privilege speak place important bill.
part committee scrutinised line line,, occasions, word word, several months earlier year, pleasure see many colleagues committee room 10 present today—a reunion sorts., always, intention improving bill, indeed pass, vulnerable people protected possibly unintended consequences.
important remember report third reading voting whether agree principle assisting someone end life.
role vote law front us—on whether words page clear intended, whether statutory process safe, ultimately whether provision assisted dying benefits community.
assisted dying principle, bill.
happy put record personal religious beliefs; bill simple reason harm far people help.
people harmed vulnerable communities, willing accept collateral damage.
today important, opportunity improve safeguards bill groups better protected.
urge members take opportunity full.
requires little skill draft law works 90% cases, much skill ensuring 10% catered well.
urge everyone set highest standards today think ensure unordinary unexpected cases adequately protected,.
really life death, please accept anything good enough.. member agree one greatest risks bill around coercion?
coercion family members friends, societal coercion circumstances.
current state palliative care country among worst developed world.
without adequate palliative care, patients might feel pressure go assisted dying route instead.
wholeheartedly agree.
much discuss today little time, start beginning bill, point criteria eligibility assisted death set.
important safeguards needed ensure never eligible excluded.
make mistake assuming always make right decision infallible.
incumbent put place law makes harder get wrong—that makes harder someone vulnerable fall cracks..
lady agreed point made.
member dewsbury batley( iqbal mohamed).
exactly point made house voted assisted dying(.)
bill back 2015.
would say nine years house voted bill, saw golden age palliative care result, think wait palliative care perfect might never vote favour assisted dying?
evidence clear palliative care get better assisted dying introduced; heard bill committee.
absolutely look address palliative care, benefit people.
come point later speech, discuss.
want get ahead.
many helpful amendments vein—namely, new clause 16, new clause amendments 80, 14, 38, 81, 24, 30 31.
simple terms, seek tighten refine eligibility criteria assisted death setting reasons assisted death allowed, ensuring vulnerable protected something may best interests.
interestingly, second reading argument put forward assisted death dying spared unbearable pain.
argument everyone understands full sympathy.
one place wants people endure pain come end life; certainly would want loved ones indeed time comes.
arguments put forward changed.
less emphasis pain, choice autonomy.
word “autonomy” came committee—and autonomy important, course, point.
proposal provide humane end someone' pain cannot relieved last months life, moved proposal provide assisted death service choose reason, even pain alleviated palliative care.
approach, however, comes cost others: family, clinicians broader society.
really momentous.
going back massive shift.
move autonomy trumping everything else changes everything.
new clause 16, tabled.
friend, important.
jurisdictions passed laws, third people report taken step feel burden others.
truth it—it always pain—and kind autonomy leads disaster.
thank right.
friend making point; absolutely right.
tabled amendment 80, would bring bill back original intentions.
would require order eligible assisted death, pain discomfort experienced expected person' terminal illness could reasonably relieved satisfaction palliative care.
seeks limit assisted death small group people may benefit, larger group need adequate palliative care give comfortable, dignified death deserve.. member' amendment speaks “severe pain discomfort”, reason medical profession gone.
propose assess severe pain discomfort opposed medium pain?
fungating wound part severe pain discomfort?
key point need improve palliative care.
spending much time effort focusing bill rather thing would actually help people.
amendment 80, combination amendments 30 31 tabled.
friend member runnymede weybridge( dr spencer), would drive significant improvements palliative end-- life care, getting closer consistent universally available care.
support.
lady' amendment.
royal college psychiatrists pointed, pain unresolved physical symptoms fear physical pain death make person want die, depression, also associated wish die, often missed.
agree vital people supported free pain access good palliative end-- life care, bill' provisions available cannot help?
completely concur.
commend.
lady tabling amendments.
amendments would protected palliative care hospices facilitating assisted suicide services premises ethical practical reasons rejected, bill leaves hospices little choice comply.
also puts difficult position comes funding.
hospices also provide staff member work.
problems create palliative care hospices cannot ignored.
bill goes right totality.
agree, come point detail second half speech.
regard amendments, blessed precious nhs.
vital stages, nhs quite rightly delivers care obstetrics, gynaecology, neonatology paediatrics, end life 70% care delivered outside nhs, largely charities, figure even higher children' palliative hospice care—so state pays enter life, depart.
something deeply wrong society.. friend agree surely must address, delivery universal palliative hospice care, go anywhere near measures assisted dying bill?.
friend makes good point, agree.
interests time, make progress.
current situation, whereby fully funded palliative end-- life care available certain postcodes, means unfortunate patients real choice.
know 25% people die country get palliative care need—that 100, 000 people year—and bill goes, offered fully funded assisted death reliable way end pain.
choice.
urge members want see improvements palliative end-- life care vote amendment 80, amendments 30 31, tabled.
friend member runnymede weybridge, pushed vote..
friend give way?
much time.
move lack best interests test bill, new clause 16 seeks remedy.
patient autonomy course important, must balanced someone' best interests.
certain situations, best interests, treatment given patient' will—for example, force- feeding young girl anorexia.
easy balance get right, absence best interests test bill, following process rigidly would lead devastating results cases.
bill currently prioritises autonomy patient specific moment time, rather might best interests long run.
makes allowance fact someone may feel certain way temporarily due considerations.
example, someone received terminal diagnosis, understandably cause depressive state suicidal feelings, feelings necessarily last, may best interests patient allow little time pass, give little breathing space considering assisted death route.
new clause 16 essentially tries provide best interests test excluding certain reasons, alleviation pain, might driving patient' decision.
example, heard great deal internal pressure patients driven concern burden, heard clearly committee patient could tell want assisted death financial reasons, would still approved.
know experience overseas territories patients often opt assisted death social welfare issues, homeless.. lady give way?
sorry, much time wish get points.
happy process exclude reasons?
instead providing support actually needed, state content put pathway leads death.
hope house recognise, whether one supports assisted dying principle, morally bankrupt kind best interests test protect seeking death alleviate pain terminal illness.
another group particularly vulnerable eating disorders.
chelsea roff' oral evidence, set “at least 60 people around world euthanised assisted suicide” “anorexia nervosa listed name terminal condition. ”
––[ official report, terminally ill adults( end life) public bill committee, 29 january 2025;.
139, q175.]
paraphrase, young women terminally ill decades life ahead.
important make point someone suffering— rose— rose— would love give way, but—
order.. lady said going give way.
aiming 15 minutes speech, going 20 minutes pick pace.
apologise, want get speech.
important make point someone suffering anorexia, indeed mental condition, intended eligible assisted death.
however, case anorexia physical manifestations illness, malnutrition diabetes, might mean patient meets definition terminally ill, nub problem: bill adequately rule physical manifestations caused mental illness.
amendment 14, tabled.
member bradford west( naz shah), important, would ensure anyone voluntarily stops eating drinking ineligible assisted dying.
support amendment strongly addresses big risk.
lastly, eligibility specifically, want talk capacity.
problems current approach determining capacity barely know start.
comes ending one' life, higher standard applied.
current definition capacity created monumental decision mind, drafted scratch today, would look different.
one reasons royal college psychiatrists support bill.
bill, person assumed capacity first instance.
clinician needs 50% sure person capacity.
person making unwise decisions, taken account, person “helped” make decision—for example, patient learning disabilities.
ask members today whether happy.
sound like robust approach assessing whether someone capacity make decision end life?
let begin starting presumption capacity.
,, lacks standard assisted death decisions.
therefore support amendment 24, tabled.
member bexleyheath crayford( daniel francis), would disapply section() mental capacity act 2005 purposes assisted dying.
one biggest issues fact current approach requires impairment disturbance brain order someone considered capacity, irrespective whether make decision.
real world, would mean could assess patient gives impression confused, illogical, erratic, inconsistent—everything could scream good place make decision point time—but would still considered capacity identifiable impairment disturbance mind brain.
could potentially put depression, anxiety, learning disabilities eating disorders, even experiencing physical pain driving distraction, danger considered capacity.
far focused eligibility.
talk hospices.
order.
please, really want get many people possible.
come conclusion, would helpful.
therefore speak new clauses 17 18, would provide important protections hospices, currently lacking bill.
new clause 18 makes crystal clear regulated care home hospice decide whether provide assisted dying premises, new clause 17 makes clear cannot subject detriment providing permitting assisted deaths, public funding cannot conditional providing service.
whether one favour assisted dying, must preserve rights organisations, companies charities choose whether offer.
must never forced public funding conditional provision assisted dying.
note new clause 10, tabled.
member spen valley( kim leadbeater), would expand protection individuals participate assisted dying process wish.
seeks protect employees subjected detriment participating participating provision assisted dying.
sensible protection would ensure nhs hospital provides assisted death service, member staff want participate would would suffer detriment result.
however, needs sensible mechanism balancing employer' right set policy assisted dying, amendment() new clause 10 seeks do—we already talked, go.
want talk process family, looks like time.
end.
thank patience generosity,.
grateful chance speak support amendments, look forward hearing members.
rise speak new clauses, stand name, consequential amendment, touch others end.
amendments—without dismissive helped draft them—are imperfect.
promoter bill support government drafters tidying bill.
need acknowledge bill front today bill—more less—that passed house.
amendments made, point third reading, it—there opportunity redraft.
sadly, one amendments rejected committee.
changes discussed original bill published, even evidence committee, would better place get tighter drafting needed making good legislation.
debating society; legislating law would enable state assist people taking lives.
sad able discuss amendments.
get opportunity bill committee, commend members spend many hours discussing debating issues.
ramifications clauses want talk important potential users service, medical professionals, families health professionals.
bill currently allows doctors suggest assisted dying patient raised.
, believe—as know many others do—presents serious risk terminally ill patients, already highly vulnerable, feel pressured end lives.
realise.
friend' new clause comes good place, see inconsistent ethical obligations doctors?
british medical association suggested although duty raise issue, neither ban.
ask consider australian state victoria initially measure—a- called gagging clause—as part bill, removed caused confusion detrimental patient care.
