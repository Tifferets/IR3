become- dependent gas wind blow sun shine, want dependent foreign countries indefinitely, see future role modular nuclear reactors? kind attack mode, opposition seem dealing reality, think important correct. right. gentleman right future energy mix, outlined clean power action plan, involve range technologies. outlined range would expect, nuclear—in particular small modular reactors—will play incredibly important part. moving forward programme inherited previous government, yet another incomplete process. make happen quickly possible, smrs play key role energy mix. following previous question, clearly, previous government delay investing starting nuclear power opportunities options. progress made since government came power plans take forward nuclear power part supply?? conservative members ask, “when? —they 14 years power, 14 years build single new nuclear project. former minister nuclear,. member west aberdeenshire kincardine( andrew bowie), loves shout consultations launched, build single new nuclear power station.. friend right make point move forward nuclear—we want see nuclear projects move forward quickly possible.. friend minister nuclear moving forward two biggest projects, well small modular reactor competition. quite rightly going process ensure robust possible, say due course. last friday, met wales& west utilities, runs gas grid constituency beyond, heard hydrogen still viable option home heating. although number pilots, government recently gone quite quiet hydrogen home heating. minister update steps taking progress hydrogen home heating?. lady raises potential hydrogen energy mix. course, one real strengths gas network changed things future; real strength, looking options might. mix options available hydrogen, including home heating, could still play really key role industrial projects, example, shorter term. looking projects. need ensure financially viable worked technological details would make happen. say due course. understanding notices issued times high demand, evidence system working order prevent power cuts system breaking. would thought conservatives would learned lesson spike international gas prices caused crisis people' fuel bills led cost living crisis, learned nothing.. friend minister agree really underlines policy ensuring secure provision renewable energy, leaves less open spikes prices international market?. friend absolutely right. worth saying electricity margin notices unexpected, particularly time year. mean enough generation available meet demand, neso would like see larger safety cushion; important point people understand margin notices. notice cancelled, course, sufficient supply ensure cushion.. friend' broader point important. outlined great detail deliver clean power 2030. conservatives claim oppose; fact, oppose much net zero full stop. answer would deliver secure resilient energy system future brings bills delivers climate leadership. unconvinced, use parliamentary language, minister' reassurance lights almost go last week. also unconvinced saying system robust resilient. minister told electors scotland energy bills would come £300 government. gone, go twice. given perilous gas storage situation—it%, compared 25% eu enjoys—what steps take de- stress system accelerating investment long- duration energy storage? thank. gentleman characteristic question. first point, let say said anything margins. quoted national energy system operator, actually delivers country—and quote benefit. gentleman: “at point electricity supplies less anticipated demand engineers able rebalance system”. take leave words—i particularly bothered—but words people actually operate energy system.. gentleman' final point, absolutely agree importance long- duration energy storage., first time 40 years, government announced new cap- floor regime deliver new long- duration energy storage schemes. huge step forward position many previous governments, allow building pumped hydro schemes new innovative technologies deliver energy storage. moving fast possible. hope. friends support decisions. thank minister updating reassuring house residents robustness system, work taking forward wider diversification energy supply. update house support take- heat pumps, ensure, long run, far less dependent gas overseas? also say something importance insulation government support measures encourage insulation?. friend right well building energy system deliver generation capacity future, need work fast possible reduce demand. part moving away gas heat pumps. important energy system climate, individual households reducing bills. already see huge shift uptake heat pumps across country., course, much reach target, government committed, important households right across country. echo points insulation. fuel poverty likely live houses cold. create warmer homes—that- secretary state energy security net zero,. friend member peckham( miatta fahnbulleh), doing—the better everyone. last week coldest week winter. also last week, 41.% energy mix gas 25% wind. heard issues gas storage, government penalising oil gas sector extending windfall tax, allowing new licences, removing investment allowances. feels like government taking energy security seriously. minister reassure house case, engage oil gas companies ensure secure energy today, despite trying future? give assurance. indeed, every month job, aberdeen, meeting oil gas companies discuss issues. going agree everything, clear long future oil gas north sea. yes, absolutely said want issue new licences new fields, revoke existing licences. means continue work north sea long time come. repeat categorically untrue electricity gas supplies risk past week. robust systems place, worked exactly. consumers lost absolutely supply last days, weeks months ahead. draw attention house entry register members' financial interests membership energy unions, gmb unite. 2017, energy minister, noble lord harrington, said: “the closure rough cause problem security. ”— minister confirm five wasted years followed rough reopened reduced capacity continue impose restraints network? government take open- minded approach centrica' proposals gradually convert storage capacity hydrogen? commercial decisions centrica, although brings decisions, course look. let reiterate robust set storage facilities ensure security supply. rough one, moments, winter, important, slowest move gas system. remainder entirely robust state continue deliver, said, chooses site commercial matter centrica. heard house today- reliance gas, surely, reality,- reliance imported gas. forces government seem driving hands foreign suppliers, much 80% gas may imported 2030. support domestic sources oil gas, back 200, 000 industry jobs found constituencies across land, rather pushing people cliff? take issue two points. first, past decade, 100, 000 jobs already lost oil gas industry, happened government. gentleman supported. industry changing. putting place robust set plans help workforce jobs future, rather burying heads sand pretending basin north sea super- mature. secondly, even extract gas continental shelf, given traded international market, pricing set international market, would continue pay, whether came north sea, would deal pricing issue reflected. gentleman' question. minister assume government robbed pensioners winter fuel allowance, gas consumption would go, government obsessed net zero policy really care whether enough gas meet energy needs? minister realise reliant foreign suppliers push fuel prices? justify fact net zero policy, government ignoring fact 150 years- worth gas naturally stored, use? let repeat said moment ago: even take much gas continental shelf, would still traded international market. reason right. gentleman' constituents mine still face cost living crisis exposure petrostates dictators around world. would clearly like expose even, think conservatives would support, want get rollercoaster volatile fossil fuels deliver clean power system cheaper long run delivers energy security. best consumers, constituents. minister several times mentioned energy security, said drive net zero make energy- secure, europe learned lesson taking fossil fuels russia, take renewable resources china, manufactures processes vast majority materials needed. contingency plans minister made case china decides get trade war renewables, cut supply? threats could come china exactly came russia fossil fuels. let say two things right. gentleman. first, approach china co- operate interest, challenge necessary. point chancellor making. secondly, way ensure describes happen, build much possible country, build industrial base country bring clean power jobs. last government failed. driving forward industrial strategy ensure jobs arise clean power plan designed country. opposition either support oppose. whole discussion underlines importance electricity storage, including battery energy storage system constituency, bredbury substation. encourage communities welcome besss area, perhaps considering community benefits, district heat networks?. lady makes really important point energy storage various forms. battery storage technology moving forward extraordinarily quickly, short duration get batteries improving quite considerably, batteries key role play. importantly, potential communities drive. really clear local power plan want communities driving seat much possible, secure community benefits. also want infrastructure. weeks' time, visit scheme scotland community would able battery storage project, wind turbine fills battery. would get double benefit energy generating able store. would like see schemes right across country. certain amount sympathy. member widnes halewood( derek twigg), minister slightly fobbed answer. chance calm check notes, ask question. member' behalf: government done advance case nuclear energy since took power? good question. thank. gentleman giving second chance reiterate inherited whole series plans delivered. moved forward quickly possible deliver significant projects, also moved forward competition small modular reactors. shadow minister says, “all sign. maybe forgets state left policies departed office.
