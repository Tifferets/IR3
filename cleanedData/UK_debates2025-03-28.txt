young man amazing philosopher sadly taken soon. think family really chuffed. member included speech something fundamental right fresh, clean water. bill seeks protect right; recognises water essential basic need, therefore something universal essential surely ought completely public hands. countries around world even countenance idea privatising water; say, “it public responsibility ensure provide
