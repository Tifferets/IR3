need people microchip loved animals, particularly dogs cats. course discussion, pointed minister state bill become law, necessary guidance discussed crown prosecution service regarding exactly enforcement provisions would. hope responding debate, right. friend expand point. following discussion, thought would table new clause guidance, references debate could include references specific issue guidance would issued following enactment bill. would like guidance set clearly position people microchip cats dogs. microchipping dogs mandatory since 2010, know something% 10%. million dogs country microchipped. early june, mandatory cats microchipped, probably 70% microchipped. hope send message, discussing important legislation, someone cat dog microchipped, expect law rush assistance

deal problems conflicting complementary microchipping databases. pet theft taskforce commissioned look issues pet abduction, strongly recommended something done ensure one consistent database microchipping accessible vets, police local authorities. pleased see government issued guidance, potentially new regulations,. met, minister told come force end year. hopefully make use microchip database easier reduce costs enforcement. obviously, priority bill issue house depends largely views right.. members. government obviously believe pet abduction important issue, indeed, need keep context burden enforcement authorities bringing new laws,, new penalties essentially new pressure prosecutions. guidance important. latest figures show 2020,. million dogs country,, 000 reports dog theft. contrast, latest figures show england wales 2022- 23, 130, 521 motor vehicle thefts reported—one every five minutes. therefore need keep issue context. seems exponential increase incidence motor vehicle theft inability police prosecuting authorities investigate thoroughly prosecute perpetrators. number motor vehicle thefts resolved prosecution enforcement authorities seems derisorily low. therefore think guidance essentially says police dealing potential prosecution investigation theft unmicrochipped dog cat take precedence trying find perpetrators—often gangs—who stealing motor vehicles order streets, cases even people' garages drives.. friend generous giving way. perhaps might consider instances motor vehicles stolen order symptom organised crime, recognise pet theft key contributor organised crime. accept behind incidence pet theft organised crime, latest figures, organised crime resulted, 000 incidents dog theft, compared 130, 000 incidents motor vehicle theft, many

commits offence abduct dog without lawful authority reasonable excuse. background putting forward new clause. increasingly put cart horse accusing people crimes forcing defend allegations, instead requiring prosecuting authorities look possible defences excuses making arrest instituting prosecution. amendment designed test whether offence committed dog permanently removed someone' lawful control. look forward hearing minister' comments response. amendment designed ensure offence committed dog removed lawful control registered keeper, rather taken person. know said someone dog walker running kennels registered keeper, offence pet abduction equally apply, circumstances serious offence theft applied theft act 1968., would emphasise distinction somebody registered keeper whose details set microchip database, another person dog given safe keeping, whatever reason. amendment would test distinction requirement permanence someone depriving owner dog, essence comes theft act

clearly committee, assured. members, clause already applies relation taking ragdoll cat. amendments would exclude certain categories dog. although amendment acknowledges dogs temporarily exempt microchipping requirements medical reasons, recognise puppies microchipped eight weeks old. amendment accepted, person taking detaining puppies would entirely exempt offence dog abduction, yet know high- value puppies may subject organised crime. yesterday, consulted police crime commissioner essex, roger hirst, bill, reminded me—as essex mp, may recall case, madam speaker—that litter blue merle french bulldog puppies, valued £100, 000, nearby basildon stolen entirety, clear case organised crime. exclude puppies bill would another extremely retrograde step. amendment would effect relation dogs imported england keeper holiday less 30 days, 2023 regulations require microchipped. would also exclude certain working dogs, police army dogs, microchipped three months old; would unprotected. addition, risk relying definition laid secondary legislation crucial interpretation bill. risk unintended consequences application offences secondary legislation amended. furthermore, microchipping cats dogs( england) regulations apply northern ireland, microchipping legislation. result, amendment made, abduction dogs northern ireland would excluded scope dog abduction offence—another backward step. important recognise abduction offences bill deliberately framed around broad concept lawful control. using terms like “keeper” “owner”, bill recognises different people lawful control dogs different times. changing wording proposed amendments,, person taking dog remove lawful control dog walker, example, would committing offence. believe right dog afforded different levels protection law according individual dog happens given time. know dogs commonly abducted parks gardens, may well lawful control dog sitter, dog walker, another member family. dog stolen abducted circumstances dealt differently? believe, think people country would agree. summary, believe abducting dog abhorrent crime—i think get behind idea —regardless dog taken, exactly true cats. although course sympathetic underlying intention amendments, 16, move bill far away intended spirit. simply cannot create two- tier system microchipped animals scope legislation. given legislation implicitly recognises cats dogs sentient beings, absolutely right microchipped protected, urge. friend member christchurch press amendments. leave minister address. friend' new clause amendment 21. let address

drafting prosecution bear, usual, burden proof. referring fact bill places evidential burden defendant relation defences reasonable excuse lawful authority, need produce sufficient evidence raise issue, burden proving offence remains fairly squarely prosecution. worry wording amendments could introduce uncertainty kind burden might imposed, could impose burden defendant. reasons, urge press

exactly going say: could done fully two years ago. need today. yet another private member' bill appeared result government' abandonment animal welfare( kept animals) bill. seems real question pet abduction bill, “who abducted kept animals bill, purpose? asked question repeatedly never given answer, certain given one today. another defra mysteries—like mystery secretary state comes override
