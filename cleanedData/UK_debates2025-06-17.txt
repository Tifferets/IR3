uncontroversial step journey parent becomes protracted traumatic legal battle. law dictates duty parents register birth child within 42 days. married couples, presumption paternity husband law. means either parent may register birth unaccompanied, still recorded birth certificate. therefore, terrible event husband dies child born, widowed mother still ensure name birth certificate, common sense. however, couple unmarried, law recognise relationship way. fact mother ring finger means automatic recognition paternity. unmarried woman experiences unimaginable tragedy losing partner pregnancy, provision register child' birth certificate. unless parents present, registrar deemed unable verify paternity father. suffering grief losing loved one facing new reality parenthood alone, bereaved mothers leave register office blank space child' birth certificate, instead partner' name. order amend birth certificate, bereaved mothers seek declaration parentage lengthy, costly traumatising legal process family courts. respects, legal loophole—the effect improper outdated legislation failed provide certain set particularly tragic circumstances—but speaks deeper inequality legal system:

traumatic unnecessarily complex process. widowed young estimates issue affects many 200 women year. women join today persevered family courts, many mothers give frustration, leaving blank space child' birth certificate. system registering births governed section 10 births deaths registration act 1953 section 55a family law act 1986, make provision requiring declaration parentage. neither acts provide specific circumstances one parent deceased child born outside marriage. declaration parentage intended prove paternity deceased partner, rather resolve disputed parenthood. legal framework unfit purpose. births deaths registration act became law 1953, 95% births registered within marriage. figure reduced steadily ever since, half children born within marriage. times changed society moved, yet law kept pace. bill would drag legislation 21st century, provide clear simple process registering deceased partner' name birth certificate. achieve placing greater reliance registrar' professional judgement. right evidence, registrars allowed amend birth certificate, similarly empower correct absence deceased parent, provided receive sufficient evidence intended parenthood. across europe—in switzerland, france germany—unmarried parents encouraged register parentage antenatal appointments. similar system could created, declaration intended parentage could made pregnancy. contest importance rigorous process proving intended parenthood, importance argument support change law,, process currently non- existent. officials often unable advise women register deceased partner parent, guidance. remains clear route proving intended parenthood, bereaved unmarried mothers denied basic right. anachronistic legal framework causing immense trauma mothers children. bill would take direct action address injustice, providing clear process bereaved mothers follow, allowing registrar include deceased partner child' birth certificate. small change law would make huge difference. would
