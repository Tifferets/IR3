2023. dear members: write urge oppose weakening law protects millions sports fans spectators attend professional collegiate sporting events year. current statutory ban aircraft-- including unmanned aircraft systems(`` uas) drones-- flying large stadium sporting events throughout country provides necessary safety security protections real potential threats. deeply concerned section 813 house version federal aviation administration(`` faa) reauthorization act. adopted, language would establish broad complex waiver program would permit countless aircraft fly near stadiums games, putting millions fans risk, unnecessarily. wisely eliminated similar waiver program back 2003, discovering troubling persistent failures, gaps, vulnerabilities process conducting background checks issuing waivers. faa first established flight restrictions large stadium sporting events immediately following terrorist attacks september 11, 2001, response concerns terrorists using aircraft weapons. subsequently twice codified strengthened restrictions, providing specific criteria aircraft operations permitted within flight restricted area. section 813 would effectively eliminate specific criteria replace open- ended waiver program. long- standing, congressionally mandated flight restriction enhances safety security large stadium events, minimizing disruption national airspace system(`` nas). specifically, airspace large stadiums-- seating capacity 30, 000 people nfl, mlb, ncaa division football games major motor speedway events, nascar indycar races, taking place-- closed
