made 2005 2007 led 28- month delay sending letters women born 1950s. ombudsman says delays result women suffering direct financial loss maladministration. accept 28- month delay sending letters maladministration, behalf government, apologise. government determined learn lessons went wrong, say moment. also agree women suffered direct financial loss maladministration. however, agree ombudsman' approach injustice remedy, want spell. first, report properly take account research showing actually considerable awareness state pension age increasing. references research 2004 showing 43% women aged 16 aware state pension age, sufficiently recognise evidence research 73% women aged 45 54—the group covers women born 1950s—were aware state pension age increasing, research 2006 showing 90% women aged 45 54 aware state pension age increasing. secondly, report says letters sent earlier, would affected women knew state pension age. however, agree sending letters earlier would impact ombudsman says. research given ombudsman shows around quarter people sent unsolicited letters actually remember receiving reading, cannot accept, great majority cases, sending letter earlier would affected whether women knew state pension age rising increased opportunity make informed decisions. two facts—that women knew state pension age increasing letters significant ombudsman says—as well reasons, informed conclusion scheme financial compensation 1950s- born women response ombudsman' report. ombudsman says, matter principle, redress compensation normally reflect individual impact. however, report acknowledges assessing individual circumstances. million women born 1950s would significant cost administrative burden. taken ombudsman nearly six years investigate circumstances six

taxpayers' money, least previous government failed set aside single penny compensation scheme left £22 billion black hole public finances. extremely difficult decision take, believe right course action, determined learn lessons ensure type maladministration never happens. first, want work ombudsman develop detailed action plan report, every lessons learned. secondly, committed setting clear sufficient notice changes state pension age, people properly plan retirement. thirdly, tasked officials develop strategy effective, timely modern communication state pension uses- date methods, building changes already made, online “check state pension” service gives personal forecast person' state pension, including take, one size rarely fits. said, taken decision lightly, believe right
