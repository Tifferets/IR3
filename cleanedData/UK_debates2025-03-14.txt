others, take beyond 50% rate given tilly. jonathan today, today. nobody told amazing thing mp would people meet almost daily, want make community, country even world better place. particularly true people humbled meet journey speaking bill today, including cancer patients, survivors, bereaved campaigners, want one thing: justice. although healthcare system founded notion equality, fairness justice, believe rare cancer patients overlooked. demand justice covers three points. first beating rare cancer less likely beating cancers. said 47% cancer diagnoses year rare less common types. patients already cards stacked, 17% less likely survive—an injustice caused relative lack research development field many years. secondly, rare cancer mean less likely benefit medical breakthrough. according cancer52, 2024, astonishing 82% patients rare less common cancers offered clinical trial, denied access potentially lifesaving treatments. often trials even exist, little progress, exist, always easy patients access. let give example: remarkable young woman constituency known kira machine. kira living neuroblastoma since 10.: prognosis inoperability, 26 rounds chemotherapy eight relapses. mum, aud, fundraising legends locally. know school workplace edinburgh help given three weeks raise £500, 000 lifesaving specialist treatment. 21 fundraising cancer sufferers, kira example.

leading question. course good enough. think anybody thinks good enough, including minister. unfortunately, present clinical trials country rare cancer treatments. families kira' need crowdfund treatment overseas; building capacity. thirdly, rare cancer mean diagnosis delayed compared diagnoses cancers. rare cancer sufferers tell symptoms often less likely recognised, doctors less familiar.

globally, new treatments developed rolled patients, improving outcomes saving lives nhs every single day. however, rare cancer patients left behind, need explain. due lack effort charities affected disease. fact, gallery today members incredible charities fighting rare cancers often uphill battle. thank hard work helping develop bill—they really helped me—which aims address injustices faced rare cancer patients families. people met charities, work much job; making difference people' lives, improving survivability supporting families. reason uphill battle research rare cancer much less appealing pharmaceutical companies compared common conditions. smaller patient populations, increased logistical challenge bringing patients together. currently, lacking sufficient development

companies face challenge selling drug developed great expense small market. ultimately, companies exist return profit shareholders. given choice investment potential treatment rare cancer common one, often rare cancer patients lose. set challenges faced diagnosed rare cancers, let address bill aims accomplish. list four key measures explain impact: appointing named responsible lead delivery rare cancer research; creating single registry rare cancer trials; creating single registry rare cancer patients available trials; defining evidence base repurposing new cancer treatments. let explain turn important. first, bill would place duty secretary state facilitate promote research related rare cancer patients. appointment national specialty lead rare cancers national institute health care research would provide secretary state advice design planning research facilitate collaboration relevant parties. ensure co- ordination accountability delivery new cancer research. secondly, bill would increase access clinical trials via service tailored rare cancer patients. secretary state' new duties, would accomplished part existing “be part research” registry, ensuring trials registered single place. thirdly, charities clinicians tell trials would attracted easier access patient cohorts. establishing single database willing patients would remove significant burden researchers finding verifying eligible people clinical trials. congratulate. gentleman introducing bill important subject. mentions research. explain extent clauses limited england wales? happening scotland relation

introduced. friend member edinburgh south west( dr arthur). begin paying tribute father- law shared stories today.. friend' story, like many, stark reminder aggressive- researched cancers, leaving patients little hope. assumed rare cancers, mentioned today, affect low number people, case. cancer research says rare less common cancers account 47% cancer diagnoses 55% cancer- related deaths. 82% rare cancer patients never even consulted joining clinical trial. means individual rare cancer may affect relatively people, together make almost half cancer cases, yet funding research remain disproportionately low. briefly mention charlie shrager, one constituents gravesham. like many, fighting cholangiocarcinoma, bile duct cancer. supposedly rare devastating form liver cancer, rising

seeing people left behind find cure everybody. already heard much moving powerful testimony debate, despite tragic impact rare cancers people across, garner little attention,- researched lack investment treatment. though cancer survival rates rose nearly 10% 2005 2020, rare cancers still lowest survival rates, leaving many people without hope. thank. member edinburgh south west( dr arthur) introducing bill. argue favour today, using three examples: first, story constituent suffering rare cancer; secondly, importance bill extremely rare cancers;, lastly, importance future research. many rare forms cancer individuals suffer, often without specialised treatments public awareness, every rare cancer patient name story. take constituent recently met event world cancer day, suffers- cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia. although five- year survival rate leukaemia currently stands 55%, figure acute myeloid leukaemia, rare aggressive form, one lowest cancers. 22% survival rate beyond five years diagnosis. means, sadly, nearly 80% diagnosed aml today survive end. surgery viable treatment option diagnosed leukaemia, patients often depend discovery new innovative treatments survive disease. though every cancer name story, rare little representation, even debates like. brings second example: composite hemangioendothelioma, che. first medically identified 2006, 2022 fewer 60 cases reported english- language literature. rarity, hard treat garners little attention companies could develop treatments. however, affected che names, families stories. hopefully, mentioning che debate may, small way, help raise awareness existence. bill assist matter, result appointment named person responsible overseeing delivery research rare cancer treatments. facilitate political accountability rare cancer research encourage ecosystem hopefully lead future treatments, least attention, even rarest cancers, che. talking treatments, earlier week, met constituent researcher university glasgow. stem exhibition. discussed research novel approach treating osteosarcoma. although common primary bone cancer, 160 people diagnosed osteosarcoma year uk—fewer three people every million population—making rare cancer bill. current treatments lack specificity targeting tumour often unwanted side effects. constituent' research looked potential use small molecules create effective non- invasive treatment osteosarcoma. bill' support information sharing research registry system help researchers like constituent. help research clinical trials giving researchers greater access patient population rare cancers like osteosarcoma. patient survey 2024 found 82% rare less common cancer offered clinical trial. bill important. bill help foster environment research clinical trials rare cancers osteosarcoma. patients like constituent suffering- cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia, diagnosed least- understood cancers, researchers trying find new treatments, bill represents commitment fight rare cancers. therefore urge house support. friend member edinburgh south west bill today. lost friend family member cancer doubt heard described—often, think, somewhat
