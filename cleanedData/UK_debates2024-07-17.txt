hundreds west derby leyland lay along—would believe? —boundary lane, boundary lane situated hamlet called hundred end. lesson, think, ignoring obvious right front. predecessors previous parliaments

country' new government look cause divisions neighbours, whether countries thousands miles away even towns thousand yards away. instead, work colleagues ensure government look unite country task national renewal, politics believe politics common good—a politics looks wellbeing, rather tries others. many towns villages country seen better days past years. southport different. whereas areas,
