committee homeland security january 10, 2024. professor bowman testified constitution support impeachment secretary mayorkas mere policy differences. majority report, however, twists passage professor bowmans book impeachment uses context suggest policy differences grounds impeachment. republicans also tried misrepresent professor bowmans writings hearing, afford professor bowman opportunity explain work. submitted clarifying questions professor bowman supplement hearing record, majority transmit questions professor bowman legislative report filed house. include record professor bowmans responses questions make professors thoughts impeachment policy differences abundantly clear, since republican majority cannot bothered conduct proper investigation complete record. frank. bowman iii, university missouri curators distinguished professor emeritus, floyd. gibson missouri endowed professor emeritus( academic titles provided identification purposes. opinions expressed herein author, reflect person entity, endorsed university missouri.) question#. thompson: republicans portrayed previous academic writing confirming position mere policy differences may ground impeachment. particular,`` displeasure administration personnel policy may sufficient warrant impeachment. correct? never written mere policy differences would adequate ground impeachment. contrary, join consensus view constitutional scholars ordinary policy differences proper ground impeachment. indeed, general principle particularly applicable disagreement policy presidential administration political party controlling one house, narrowest margins. quotation question alludes, one mentioned chairman green rep. bishop, occurs final paragraph chapter second edition book, high crimes& amp; misdemeanors: history impeachment age trump( cambridge univ. press 2023). congressmen take snippet text quote entirely context. referenced section chapter, discuss prior impeachment cabinet officer, president ulysses grants secretary war, william belknap. prior quoted passage, explained cabinet officer belknap impeached. primary, obvious, reason, wrote, cabinet officer`` whose behavior veered anywhere near impeachable zone simply removed president. happened belknap. took bribe. president grant found, fired belknap. house, controlled democrats first time since civil war, impeached secretary anyway means politically damaging president grant extension republicans upcoming 1876 election. final paragraph chapter,, course, saying mere`` displeasure either person policy constitutionally acceptable ground impeachment. rather, subordinate official actually committed`` treason, bribery, high crimes misdemeanors( secretary war belknap incontestably), might elect proceed impeachment signal displeasure. secretary mayorkas committed impeachable offense. impeaching cabinet officer innocent`` treason, bribery, high crimes misdemeanors indicate displeasure administration policy officers administration policy would profoundly anti- constitutional act. question#. thompson: past, written impeachable`` high crimes misdemeanors interpreted include`` serious executive misconduct, including... betrayal nations foreign policy interests president subordinates nations interests foreign interests. republican rep. guest suggested written past foreign policy differences grounds first impeachment president trump-- describe trumps`` rolling destruction american foreign policy-- past writing contradicts testimony january 10, 2024, hearing. foreign policy differences impeachable offense, foreign policy differences differ ordinary policy differences? written one accepted historical categories impeachable conduct, pre- 1787,`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests. however, saying, obviously saying ordinary policy differences presidential administration opposing political party become impeachable simply subject matter disagreement foreign, rather domestic, policy. contrary, long precedent establishes, impeachment context,`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests certain identifying features. first, impeachment purposes, nations`` foreign policy interests merely transient preferences political party faction. rather, enduring interests broad societal consensus, ideally one embodied statutes, treaties, practice multiple presidential administrations,( applicable) views nations diplomats, foreign policy experts professionals. second, word`` betrayal implies, merely changing policy adopting policy views contrary ones political adversaries, subverting national interest illegitimate, often personal, motives. british impeachments illustrate features include following. 1667, expensive unnecessary war dutch, earl clarendon impeached part seeking payments france british crown evade parliamentary controls royal finance. 1678, earl danby impeached soliciting-- behalf english king ii-- bribe louis xiv france return english neutrality franco- dutch war. clarendon danbys solicitations undercut longstanding british foreign policy objectives subjected british monarch undue foreign influence, bald attempt avoid significant parliamentary constraint royal overreach-- requirement crown obtain`` supplies(, funding addition monarchs private wealth) legislature. relevant present case american impeachments senator william blount 1797- 98 president donald trump 2020. sen. william blount: blount, senator, concocted scheme enrich giving great control territories louisiana florida. blounts scheme obviously contrary contemporary foreign policy interests inasmuch american government populace wanted expand louisiana florida, least prevent great assuming control territories. addition, articles impeachment blount charged violations neutrality act 1794, also violation treaty friendship, limits, navigation spain( scheme involved stirring native american tribes attack spanish officials interests). blounts scheme undeniably contrary foreign policy interests, multiple treaty obligations,`` betrayal obvious sense. blount tried sell interests country personal financial gain. although blount acquitted senate, historical consensus verdict turned decision senators`` civil officers subject impeachment remedy article ii, section constitution. president donald trump: president trumps first impeachment involved two articles, first charging trump committed`` high crimes misdemeanors relation scheme coerce government ukraine announcing investigations trumps likely presidential opponent, joe biden, second charging obstruction. first article captioned`` abuse power, written,`` braided together three themes... corruption, damage foreign policy interests, injury democratic process. first article impeachment summarized matter:`` president trump abused powers presidency ignoring injuring national security vital national interests obtain improper personal political benefit. also betrayed nation abusing high office enlist foreign power corrupting democratic elections.`` national security vital national interests alluded article interest supporting, militarily diplomatically, country threatened, indeed physically invaded, russia, longstanding geopolitical opponent, together interest preventing russian territorial expansion borders countries nato alliance. objectives endorsed national security interests multiple presidential administrations repeated bipartisan approval legislation authorizing military security aid ukraine. also endorsed entire diplomatic national security apparatus. government trump administration. example, trumps white house office management budget( omb) placed hold congressionally mandated aid ukraine july 2019 part president trumps scheme coerce ukraine, every relevant agency trumps administration except omb questioned hold supported military assistance ukraine national security interest. thus, trumps first impeachment precisely matches template`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests described. first, foreign policy interests case enduring interests embraced multiple presidential administrations, endorsed foreign policy professionals executive branch, manifested bipartisan legislation enacted multiple congresses. second, critically,`` betrayal interests consisted subverting national interest illegitimate personal motives-- securing personal political advantage potential political rival. trumps case, betrayal doubly severe amounted effort use presidential power corrupt democratic electoral process. secretary mayorkas: nothing alleged secretary mayorkas meets traditional criteria impeachment based`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests. said executed policy preferences president joe biden relation immigration border control issues political party control house representatives disapproves policy preferences. indication secretarys actions, indeed biden administrations policy choices, contrary established national foreign policy interests. contrary, policy regarding immigration border control varied administration administration challenges, needs, preferences country varied. importantly, absolutely indication secretary mayorkas taken official action corrupt illegitimate personal motives. repeat central point, ordinary policy differences presidential administration opposing political party become impeachable simply subject matter disagreement foreign, rather domestic, policy. question#. thompson: rep. crane suggested secretary mayorkas betrayed nation, betrayal nation would sufficient warrant impeachment. aware evidence secretary mayorkas betrayed? rep. crane suggested said`` betrayal nation potential ground impeachment, whereas actually said`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests ground impeachment. precisely mean? say testimony committee elsewhere`` betrayal nation ground impeachment. agreed black one decent definition`` high crimes misdemeanors covers cases offenses`` extremely serious, way corrupt subvert political governmental process, plainly wrong person honor, good citizen, regardless words statute books. nothing alleged secretary mayorkas meets general definition impeachable conduct. also written one specific category impeachable`` high crimes misdemeanors`` betrayal nations foreign policy interests. previous answer, explain meant phrase purposes impeachment demonstrate secretary mayorkas conduct fall within. finally, aware evidence secretary mayorkas betrayed nation. contrary, based facts aware, secretary mayorkas appears capable, dedicated public servant trying best carry policy priorities president manage perennial intractable problems related immigration control southern border. rise recognize importance credit unions competitive financial services
