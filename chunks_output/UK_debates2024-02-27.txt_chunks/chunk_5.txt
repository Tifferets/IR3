thank minister answer.
new nuclear holds key ensuring energy security creating thousands high- skilled, well- paid jobs areas located, often planning process take years, even sites long- established nuclear use.

great british nuclear currently running competitive process select small modular reactor technologies best able facilitate operational projects 2030s.
said, project needs run course, know.
friend understand decision sites yet made.'
first nuclear fusion power plant due built short 45- minute drive lincoln.
increase energy generation hopefully limit amount agricultural land used house solar farms..
friend update house role institutions university lincoln providing research training types power plants associated advanced jobs future?
indeed exciting time fusion country.
fusion futures programme provide £55 million five years train, 200 people, helping meet demands growing fusion sector.

government good opportunity meet energy security ambitions lead way..
friend provide assurances work western gateway severn edge?
heard say competition run course, course run ahead summer recess?.
friend tempting.

nuclear power plants come huge- front capital cost.
even small modular reactors considerable price tag, important government get procurement right.
minister agree smrs offer possibilities economies scale?
large number could commissioned, giving potential savings taxpayer delivering reliable baseload supply national grid.
yes, course agree.
one huge benefits, along many others, small modular reactors, running selection programme, supporting exports country across world countries join nuclear journey, investing small modular, advanced modular gigawatt- scale projects next years.
delivery nuclear power stations northern ireland something would welcome, parties northern ireland might concerns.
one thing northern ireland agree, part great great northern ireland, must part manufacturing base procurement process.
minister confirm people northern ireland opportunity?
confirm, put record support companies northern ireland already integral supply chain nuclear sector.
nuclear revival deliver secure, robust clean energy baseload, potential create thousands new manufacturing supply chain jobs across country, want impact positively every corner great northern ireland.
