subjectivity actually fundamental part legal system already: talk often man clapham omnibus.
reasonableness test, think anything bill scope inappropriate.
inclined agree comment, bill suggests, something needs airing consideration.
detailed consideration committee would appropriate place happen.

robust action counter slapps forms needed needed.
sought work alongside government ensure approach underpinning economic crime corporate transparency act—which positively received across civil society, media legal professions, including regulators—remains largely intact bill achieves necessary.
bill therefore keep, part, definition slapp claim economic crime corporate transparency act, also broaden scope capture slapps future.
future, slapps cases speaking public interest, including publications economic crime, caught.
let address components definition.
first, claimant acted restrain defendant' exercise right freedom speech.
secondly, exercise right pursuit public interest, exposing potential wrongdoing bad behaviour, illegality untruths, matters public health safety climate environment.
thirdly, claimant misused litigation threat cause harm defendant, specifically harassment, stress expense, beyond ordinarily expected properly conducted litigation.
last point includes important distinction.
legal cases almost always bring measure stress expense parties involved, given serious nature.
said, slapp claims often designed generate excessive stress expense pursuit remedy mere fig leaf, excuse allow real harm claimant wishes cause.
one thing distinguishes slapp claim legal action pursued appropriate remedy, means, right, bringing oppression bear.
safeguard harm effective proportionate way, including ensuring legitimate claims proceed, bill introduce new early dismissal test.
claimants show likely succeed trial.
cannot, case struck.

slapps likely evolve, need legal infrastructure robust enough meet future challenges.
result bill, courts necessary tools guidance deal swiftly slapps, aim stifle freedom speech.
investigative journalists also empowered expose wrongdoing forms, whatever may.
hope defendants cases, consequence, feel safe attempts wrongly exploit legal system.
journalists others empowered shine light criminal misconduct wherever find, whatever form takes, without fear spurious claims made.
unscrupulous individuals corporations brazenly misuse courts legal system agendas, detriment public interest, though wrong matter principle.
public must know wrongdoing corruption, democratic society function rule law preserved.
bill recognises breadth depth slapps; currently, law focuses solely economic crime, slapps found areas law.- embracing legislation slapps, believe, truly significant step ensuring freedom speech removing clear abuse legal system.
therefore urge colleagues across house give bill full support.
