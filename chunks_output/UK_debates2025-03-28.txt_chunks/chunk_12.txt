finish couple points.
country suffers serious flooding almost every year.
experienced pain constituents others face result.
part,, brought unusual weather patterns excessive rainfall.
also need think seriously natural river management natural flood prevention; specified bill, important.
city york, example, confluence rivers.
always danger flooding, rivers flowing.
could combination solutions.
one, yes, flood defence walls, concrete barriers protect central york flooding.
however, also management happens upstream.
deforest upstream, build floodplains prevent river following natural course, end flooding.
lots small- scale natural defences one flooding, building floodplains, rivers meandering rather flowing straight lines, letting beavers build dams streams.
whole lot solutions, add something valuable good.
thought water companies; done imagination.
farmers shropshire promoting exactly kind solution.
likewise, happened river parrett, excessive flooding, partly resolved—but completely—by environment agency recreating peat bogs hills.
lot things, require imagination.
water company, whose sole interest making money water industry, interested.
public must voice process, bill ensures.
levels pollution truly shocking—the sewage flows danger.
water drink pure clean, limit much scrubbing water done make clean.
