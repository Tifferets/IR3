aware time marching, madam, would like say briefly six key areas commission seeking views.
point—it jon cunliffe.
rattle key areas sit.
strategic management water; overarching regulatory system; economic regulation; environmental drinking water regulation; water company ownership models; asset health supply chains.
areas contains degree technical challenge., constituents—i hope asking constituents contribute process—can put, lot technical experts areas also need provide input.
jon cunliffe put ministers.
another point ministers accept jon says, want go detail,.
friend minister would presumably power—of course power; minister—to seek information.
aware commissions set badly, problem government, thorough approach, right approach years privatisation recent extensive challenges, particularly sewage discharges.
easy think rush sort, need measured way.
always impatient—we get elected make change tomorrow—but looked failed projects decade.
rush plan right, spend money often results failure.
could list projects, madam, try patience.
compliment good friend.
member norwich south( clive lewis) passion, commitment, knowledge determination.
may say, also grateful mentioned late, great david graeber introduction.
good friend, amazing young man amazing philosopher sadly taken soon.
think family really chuffed.
member included speech something fundamental right fresh, clean water.
bill seeks protect right; recognises water essential basic need, therefore something universal essential surely ought completely public hands.
countries around world even countenance idea privatising water; say, “it public responsibility ensure provide clean safe water everybody.
government margaret thatcher others privatised water 1980s, many strongly opposed it—i think member chamber privilege voting privatisation time.
predicted would lead rip- public sector, asset stripping land resources water boards built.
also pointed water infrastructure enjoy—the reservoirs wales, scotland england, piping, sewage works, hugely complex elements infrastructure—was, part, built public enterprise public investment.
laud work bazalgette producing sewage system london.
done private sector; done victorian investment public structure bring proper treatment sewage provide clean water people london.
proud public investment brought water system, recognise since 1989, water privatised, £72 billion taken dividends water companies.
amounts £2 billion year invested water—not invested new pipes protecting system.
profits extraordinary.. member hackney south shoreditch( dame meg hillier) rightly talked amount pollution flowing rivers.
cannot get head around fact 300, 000 hours- worth sewage pumped thames last year alone.
add amount pumped severn, trent, humber, mersey great rivers across country, realise scale problem dealing.
realise happens that—the sewage goes sea, comes back fish.
pollutes water, stop river' mouth; goes oceans, creating global water pollution.
surely much better.
therefore welcome bill, invite members look seriously clauses.
clause sets measures required secretary state' strategy, including measures prioritising investment, collaborating local authorities using natural flood management techniques, requirement local authorities take account need conservation—all incredibly sensible measures delivered public authorities.
privatised water companies top line conservation natural world environment.
top line, middle line bottom line profits take.
please, nobody tell £72 billion paid dividends reinvested british economy.
tax havens world.
subsidising tax havens world back polluted privatised water industry.
clause relates commission water, fascinating proposal.
commission would include representatives water companies—which privatised moment would hopefully publicly owned—union representatives water industry, environmental conservation groups, water users, would local businesses, local authorities.
strongly support public ownership water, envisage situation prime minister, gift friends, puts british water board.
would like retain existing system managing river basin areas—thames, severn trent.
makes sense, primary water supply comes.
would managed commission includes workforce, trade unions, local authorities area, local businesses, use water supply services locally, others appointed elsewhere.
would public buy- structure, would give much better democratic system.
urge members look imagination.
member norwich south put forward.
say, “we can’t possibly bring public ownership might cost money.
1945 labour government started nationalising bank england 1946 went bring many industries public ownership.
even ted heath government 1971 brought rolls- royce public ownership created rolls- royce( 1971) ltd company failing.
agreed share price set parliament—it set market cases.
case.
right.
gentleman stood election 2019 manifesto public ownership utilities water companies.
cost job, public decided give labour worst electoral thumping history.
take responsibility?
reflect point advocating already rejected country?
thank.
member incredibly friendly helpful intervention.
