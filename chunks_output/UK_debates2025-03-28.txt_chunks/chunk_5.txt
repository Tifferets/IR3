privatisation supposed keep prices, done opposite.
one third people' bills used pay interest debt, pay dividends shareholders.
government taking steps improve situation.
absolutely welcome steps, far go, issues likely go away without considering option, looking possibility, bringing water companies back public hands.

people struggling put food table heat homes.
cannot allow water companies contribute situation hiking bills everyone pay.
without real change, stop sewage flowing rivers profits flowing pockets shareholders.
