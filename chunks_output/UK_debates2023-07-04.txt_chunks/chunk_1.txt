take long time build, government supporting investment infrastructure critical future energy security?
discussed matter sse relation particular hydro storage project,.
friend-
secretary state met msps yesterday discuss subject well.
keen kind hydro storage, plans allow taken forward.
however, say opposition members—all them—that good one kind storage one kind tidal power; also need protect scottish economy oil gas make sure subjected putin dictator holding ransom energy security.
good hear secretary state supporting economy scotland, question: government investing grid capacity wales?
wales, investment crucial support energy transition projects holyhead hydrogen hub, minesto, morlais, bp mona, lightsource bp, course, new nuclear wylfa.
grid capacity scotland, wales, england northern ireland top list.
winser review done lot work look speed delivery capacity, given big transition going country' big lead renewables, makes necessary.

friend question.
enormous enthusiasm government side house potential nuclear, including small modular reactors.
