issues going debated covid inquiry.
government something actively?.
friend, ever, making powerful case.
indication whether covid inquiry—or even bill; entirely clear reading, although perhaps correct me—any changes made retrospectively, cases already considered, either disability threshold maximum compensation, would revisited event changes made?.
friend makes good point.
view changes retrospective relation whose claims already dealt.
relatively small number people respect causation established disability threshold 60% met could dealt routine way.
also bigger issue whether £120, 000 payment, increased since 2007, updated line inflation.
raised minister past, said looking taking account points made.
blatant abuse.
2007 government thought £120, 000 reasonable payout, think significantly lower sum real terms appropriate?
government cause rampant inflation, one main beneficiaries, refusing index tax allowances line inflation.
government' coffers filling result inflationary pressures, yet continue scrooge- like relation people right thing got vaccinated interests public health suffered consequences adverse reaction.
good enough.
government listen?
hope happen result debate pressure government must feeling happen covid inquiry.
points made submissions covid inquiry, important lady hallett counsel inquiry made quite clear spending lot time looking particular issues.
longer government able avoid answering questions, able house raise questions give non- answers.
facing cross- examination counsel inquiry held account actions lack action., although bill obviously get second reading, government need take account act recommendations, issue going go away.
conscious members want speak debate, make couple points.
government prepared increase rate people paid, going get anywhere?
moment, people sadly victims contaminated blood scandal show 60% disability order qualify compensation.
equivalence compensation payable contaminated blood inquiry paid become victims covid- 19 vaccines?
look personal injury payouts judicial college guidelines, 60% disability equivalent- knee amputation one leg.
guidelines, would give rise damages—just trauma—of anything £105, 000 £137, 000. consequential loss flowing that—the loss earnings, health costs rest it—would addition.
show paltry sums?
makes case- fault system.
messing around trying establish liability?
somebody confirmed perfectly healthy vaccine suffers lot adverse consequences, accept, absence explanation, must assumed consequences direct result vaccine?
interestingly, oxford university' centre socio- legal studies described vaccine damage payments act 1979 “no- fault compensation scheme”.
would., would.
one important issues addressed government.
indeed, addressed jurisdictions.
let remember years government said vaccines absolutely safe effective—there qualification.
germany' health minister said something similar, recently retracted, saying got wrong although safe effective respects, safe effective everybody.
result, germany paying significant sums people adversely affected.
government need address issue seriously try get back right foot advance hearings covid inquiry next july.
ask house supports bill second reading.
pleasure see chair,.
commend.

pointed, sponsor bill support wholeheartedly.
would also like encourage think extending scope bit deals damage caused vaccines, seeks try prevent damage happening first place.
obviously, people severely disabled, cases, died result vaccine, comfort; want prevent happening first place things could usefully done try help regard.
course, authorities love play fact people suffered adverse reactions covid- 19 vaccines.
sure many contact constituents experienced serious symptoms following vaccination.
talking sore arm, many people suffered result vaccination, range life- changing conditions strokes, heart attacks blood clots, name.. friend mentioned anna morris kc submission covid inquiry; said, normal side effects anybody would reasonably expect pharmaceutical product.
much hope, minister responds debate, puts clearly record government accept people suffered adverse reactions covid- 19 vaccine, cases, serious adverse reactions.

anticipate speech regards.
doubt say vaccine programme great success gave vast majority people great deal benefit.
point particular case,.
