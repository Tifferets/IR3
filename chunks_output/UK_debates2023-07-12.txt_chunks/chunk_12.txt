sense germany genuinely 10 times ahead capacity, people might think, “well, germany country incredible automotive history, reputation strength”, countries already losing.
spain, instance, active industrial strategy comes automotive sector, eastern europe tremendous success area.
automotive regional markets, simply seeing countries huge consequences potential investment country.
crucially, playing' strengths areas research development, like fantastic programmes battery industrialisation centre warwick,.
friend member sheffield, heeley able visit recently.. friend rightly talked producing batteries, position hydrogen similar: look germany, particularly buses bigger vehicles, years behind.
really need invest area.
thoroughly agree—the scale ambition see around world daunts compare government' ambition.
incredibly exciting technologies, including sodium- ion batteries would reduce dependence lithium almost certainly cut costs battery production.
hydrogen clearly going extremely exciting, fuel cells, markets- road vehicles could huge potential markets.
also forget buses: area new technology could contribute things like cleaner air, well better transport.
shadow minister agree top battery innovation hydrogen innovation, leading another field: synthetic fuels?
however, giving automotive sector really strong future country involves whole- system analysis, vehicle manufactured energy run manufactured.
involves looking zero tailpipe standards coming, whole- system analysis, get green technology greener transport whole- picture effect.
agree part.
gentleman said.
agree whole- system analysis: many parts decarbonisation journey industry need take much bigger question simply unplugging one form old fossil fuel technology plugging another.
instance, steel industry think scrap make conversion electric arc furnaces; move towards synthetic fuels, clearly look feed stocks coming.
however, one defining features past 13 years—i say without kind partisanship—has series ambitious targets government areas relate decarbonisation, real means deliver.
target pulled away, confidence british state decarbonise falls apart.
thinking particularly famous “cut green crap” comments former prime minister, david cameron, regarding home insulation.
talk changing existing government policy, underestimate little confidence international business community government' promises times.
broadly, approach ambitious targets means actually deliver, undermines case.. friend making effective speech.
talking targets, come roll- charging points?
constituency three motorways incredibly high levels pollution.
need remove barriers, net zero reducing pollution..
friend agree constituencies north mine need situation addressed?
shameful, understand, chargers installed westminster year across whole north england.
north issues pollution, need move faster addressing.. friend may planning come point, important one.
incredibly grateful.
friend making points.
approach front bench—from, industrial policy,.
friend member sheffield, heeley transport policy—must bring two things together.
need policies place make country world leader production vehicles ensure also works consumers.
raises fact charging points westminster—i know.
friend' constituency, far mine—and difference comparable parts country, north south, level, density availability chargers unthinkable, let alone comparison norway, instance.
enough chargers grid, maintenance connection issues often mean order.
absolutely assure.
friend shadow cabinet potential government think issues, vehicle production consumers paramount.
clearly, consumers want purchase electric vehicles—that growth part market—but often infrastructure place.
cannot form novelty.
driven electric vehicles around greater manchester something novelty—i could get access chargers, times, preferential parking spaces near deansgate, small thing—but mass market usage, neither policies infrastructure yet place.
needs widely recognised.
international trade position, always imperative domestic battery industry, become existential issue government' approach trading relationship eu. discussed relation regional export markets, eight 10 vehicles made last year exported, widely recognised impending cliff edge trade co- operation agreement eu rules origin serious challenge future sector.
government far slow realise scale danger, may promise deal coming soon, afraid “soon” cannot come soon enough.
major manufacturers including stellantis, jaguar land rover ford warned failure reach deal would cost jobs.
two half years since trade co- operation agreement formally signed.
precious time could used plan prepare, two words government often fail understand.
done time?
secured investment battery capacity.
improved relationship biggest export market, certainly worked industry find solutions.
know breakthrough needed, would use plans make brexit work ensure rules origin work british manufacturers.
cannot achieve compromise without working partners europe, believe labour good- faith partner.
plan invest battery capacity, alongside compromises rules origin, sensible way forward meet climate objectives trade obligations retain industrial base.
