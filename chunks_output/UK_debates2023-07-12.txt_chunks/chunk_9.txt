primary care services across country crisis.
people cannot get gp appointment need one, pharmacies closing, people resorting diy dentistry, waiting lists mental health appointments sky high.
government point recent long- term workforce plan evidence taking action, plan partially funded nothing increase staff levels.
perhaps government spent year whipping mps vote attempts put workforce plan law, might made progress, legitimate british public expect government plan long term taking immediate measures.
blunt, clear mps sides house losing patience worried lack urgency action government fixing front door nhs.

gareth tried get appointment gp, due lack appointments day non-
existent online booking system, instructed call following morning.
next day managed get urgent referral brain mri scan, confirmed gareth suffered small stroke.
strokes, first 72 hours critical reduce chance subsequent strokes.
gp undoubtedly dealing hundreds urgent cases day, gareth, losing 24 hours due lack capacity local gp could catastrophic. real- world impact government' failure recruit retain gps, failure invest infrastructure.
let remember back 2019 government promised deliver, 000 gps.
break promise, number fully qualified gps fallen 900 since made.
falling numbers hit areas harder others.
places somerset, falling number gps causing shortage appointments.
indeed, number gps fallen 50 since 2016 area, number patients per gp increased massive 400.
shockingly, far higher vast majority england.
county hertfordshire,, 203 patients per gp. heard denise, spent best part day hold giving trying online booking system, turned non- existent.
hold hours phone gp, contrast took two minutes denise book online appointment specsavers.
everybody knows technology exists; funded gp services.
liberal democrats pledged ensure, 000 gps working system within five years, campaign train recruit retain experienced practitioners.
expanded workforce, everyone could see gp within seven days first appointment.
however, number staff putting pressure gp services.
royal college general practitioners' recent infrastructure report showed 40% general practice staff say premises fit purpose.
even integrated care boards want spend money primary care infrastructure city centres, example, outdated treasury rules allow to—something happening st albans constituency, raised chamber yesterday.
putting retention measures place, accelerating improvements infrastructure, fixing outdated treasury rules investment primary care infrastructure three challenges general practice independent reviewer could report progress house every three months fixed.
dentistry,, see government incompetence work.
last year, £400 million underspend nhs dentistry budget, despite millions people needing appointment thousands dentists wanting provide nhs care.
absurd.
