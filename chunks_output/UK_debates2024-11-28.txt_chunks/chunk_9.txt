sure whole house want join wishing happy thanksgiving day american friends family
, happy big birthday today clerk: joe root parliamentary estate.
huge thanks stylish expert first century—half- century, say!, man wide culture extensive learning doubtless familiar film “mad max”.
expert, image conjures desolate, chaotic landscape wreckage strewn everywhere perfect metaphor government' recent budget.
let take hospices, example.
herefordshire, blessed extraordinary st michael' hospice.
st michael' supports hundreds- patients year end life care, thousands- patients visits community.
dedicated staff, assisted 800 volunteers.
extraordinary.
shudder think would cost state provide kind quality care—certainly £20 million year.
labour budget done st michael' hospice?
changes national insurance alone cost hospice extra £250, 000 next year, part.
time, budget directly indirectly pushed wage bill £450, 000. £700, 000 annually extra costs—a vast amount organisation offers incredible care, actually saves nhs £20 million year.
hospices almost every constituency affected, interests almost every colleague house.
disastrous outcome clearly never intended treasury.
another completely unnecessary blunder potentially tragic consequences.
gps, pharmacies mental health social care charities, compensation whatsoever offered tax raid.
government publish proper impact assessment explain none offered?
direct link issue assisted dying.
words health secretary, less, “i think palliative care, end-- life care country condition yet giving people freedom choose, without coerced lack support available.
care deliberately worsened chancellor.
personally, feel strongly pulled directions sides, one thing one doubt government business trying rush legislation house proxy.
text bill published barely two weeks prior vote tomorrow.
impact assessment legal issues analysis published.
far public debate preceding legislation, legislation preceded debate.
completely wrong way around.
perfectly clear.
members recently sent dossier promoter bill entitled, “your questions answered”.
unfortunately, far answering key questions, dossier fails even touch whole series important issues.
include bill' impact medical profession relationship medical staff patients, impact provision regulation different drugs drug cocktails required, record date protocols used case initial attempt assisted dying fails, inevitable- profit industry exploiting new law look like feel.
senior judge james munby highlighted, host questions involving judiciary process balance probabilities test coercion.
profoundly, question choice dignity actually mean different contexts.
none matters even mentioned dossier purporting give answers.
whatever one feels issue assisted dying itself—as say, feel pulled directions—this absence debate, especially many new members house, matter gravest public concern.
house well knows, government place issue.
asking assessment bill' likely impact nhs, health secretary exactly right thing: preparing civil servants clinicians could huge change asking look crucial question even addressed, let alone properly answered.
justice secretary, attacked none labour predecessor lord falconer thoroton imposing views, lordship somehow missed also making argument inappropriate principle state get involved many term “assisted suicide”.
yet another issue barely discussed.
ask right.
lady whether shares view tragedy colleagues asked vote without full proper consideration vital issues mentioned.
join right.
gentleman congratulating clerk house special birthday.
someone recently side special birthday—obviously, know look it—i welcome half- century club, hope party good mine.
leave conversation another day.
week, marked white ribbon day.
proud government pledged halve violence women girls.
also proud announced debate lord etherton' review treatment lgbt veterans today.
particularly pleased friend manchester resident carl austin- behan,, years decorated service raf, dismissed day raf found gay. deserves recognition much, many others.
know shadow leader house fairly new opposition, like colleagues, gently say idea opposition oppose government, record government.
