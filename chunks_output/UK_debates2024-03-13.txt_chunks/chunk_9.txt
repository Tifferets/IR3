low- carbon technologies scale, extend life existing gas assets, limited amount new build gas capacity also required short term replace expiring plants mature technology capable providing sustained flexible capacity.
remain committed delivering fully decarbonised electricity supply 2035, subject security supply, expect new gas capacity built net zero- ready.
government committed £20 billion carbon capture, usage storage, developing comprehensive support hydrogen.
future, unabated gas plants run limited number hours year, emissions entirely line legally binding carbon budgets.
bit tired government shunning scrutiny climate record instead relying past record, may indeed first major economy cut territorial emissions half since 1990, track achieve 2030 targets, factor consumption emissions, cut emissions 23%.
let' little less complacency minister.
know government' announcement new gas- fired power stations fact, contrary claimed, risk undermining climate targets leaving country reliant imports expensive gas.
members given opportunity question minister implications decarbonisation' energy system 2035, 95% electricity low carbon 2030.
first, statement made?
made instead chatham house, members able question minister impact decision?
secondly, minister explain proposal differs functioning existing capacity market, admit government' latest attempt stoke culture war climate?
thirdly, climate change committee clear new unabated gas plants built 2030, government' timeline developing new gas- fired power stations?
asked minister yesterday environmental audit committee; get response.
also asked done ensure gas plants zero carbon 2035; set either secretary state' speech yesterday minister today.
minister tell environmental audit committee plants would required carbon capture storage- ready hydrogen- ready.
amount meaningful plan, please give thus far unevidenced words assurance, explain government' plan support development batteries long- term storage technologies drive innovation get volatile gas good?
rather odd asked ability scrutinise, yesterday launch consultation go time,.
lady knows, front select committee yesterday.
rather strange highlight point.. lady confused, often, political.
would appear set politics always ahead climate.
struggles recognise nations framework convention climate change rules territorial emissions—countries emissions territory take place.
numbers embedded emissions wrong, care; carries political diatribe government, done major economy earth decarbonise economy.
done.
lady would it—by reduced living yurts—but growing economy 82%.
people like.
lady make people side chamber times think perhaps engaged form madness;, doesn’t half make sound like.
new gas plants consistent government' commitment decarbonise power sector 2035?
published net zero scenarios power sector—i invite.
lady read them—show building new gas capacity consistent decarbonising electricity 2035.
scenarios expect, even new gas capacity, rather 38% electricity generation 2022 came gas, figure% 2035—or, follow scenario set climate change committee, perhaps%.
going back-.
sensible insurance; keeping lights carry remarkable transformation government achieved moving appalling legacy labour party less% electricity coming renewables nearly 50% today.
announcement gas- fired power stations extremely welcome, moment kilowatt- hour electricity costs 44 cents, 17 cents cents china india.
become fundamentally uncompetitive green obsession.
want cheap electricity gas coal, postpone net zero indefinitely% global emissions.
making difference, economy growing consistently faster cheap energy.
good first step net zero obsession.
need go.
would chide right.
friend science evidence emerging time.
climate challenge emergency, looking reduce emissions.
quite right challenge saying, “we less% global emissions, make sense?
hosted cop26 got rest world commit following.
bringing carbon border adjustment mechanism 2027 precisely ensure create economically rational system supports jobs country, meeting climate challenge needs met.
call shadow minister.
little puzzled.
committee climate change credible energy experts said need small residual unabated gas system medium term, consistent fully decarbonised power system.
one disputes, barely worth announcement.
extend lives existing plants meet need.
new-
build plants needed short term replace retiring gas- fired power stations, disagreement, provided capable converting hydrogen carbon capture, government say must.
however, secretary state said yesterday chatham house meeting.
government' analysis published yesterday shows 24 gw existing gas capacity could maintained via life extension refurbishment, gw new capacity already baseline existing capacity market arrangements.
uncontroversial position analysis, hardly something worth making huge fuss., secretary state talked yesterday' chatham house conference.
given analysis, could minister enlighten number new gas plants government hoping build, given mention, 500 pages documents published yesterday?
