thought given consideration technologies gigawatt demand?
thank.
gentleman question.
suggested, different scenarios,%% total generation coming gas future, compared 38% 2022, annualised basis.
clearly,.
gentleman know better anybody deep knowledge subject, based intermittency.
depends much sun shines much wind blows, ensure robust system.
exactly.
would love people could celebrate country' global leadership fact driving forward, especially members green party, supposed care climate change.
way maintains security supply, bringing renewables, lowest- cost flexible system back, economical fashion.
welcome announcement today.
pure common sense.
wind blowing sun shining, need security supply.
although need deal climate change medium long term, must also deal security supply short term, welcome announcement.
minister agree medium longer- term security supply, must upscale hydrogen sector, hydrogen production usage, world leader hydrogen?
moment, slipping behind bit.
agree.
friend importance hydrogen.
disagree, seen projects hydrogen allocation round 1—eight projects, think—i think indication slipping behind.
truth whole world needs, everyone' analysis, international energy agency climate change committee department, suggests hydrogen carbon capture necessary bring decarbonised system seek.
absolutely right importance hydrogen.
expect developments, country leading, ccus.
great deal respect minister knowledge subject, fact, like chamber, recognises need cut carbon.
sure one, like right.
member north east somerset, would follow flat earthers.
clearly, great deal trust reliance put carbon capture storage, hydrogen.
still quite new technologies.
talked stuff 25 years.
minister seemingly forgets government power past 14 years still blocks hydrogen carbon capture storage.
case government taking position nod wink gas oil industries whose support probably need election year, part whole agenda placating right wing party?.
gentleman nearly way.
right: whole world looking carbon capture hydrogen, science says.
everybody analyses says need bur yet great level maturity.
many areas, country leading way.
cut emissions anyone else.
knows dire legacy left party 2010, less% electricity renewables, appalling, real danger go back.
gas power back-, completely sound system.
seek deliver decarbonised system 2035.
biggest risk would right.
member doncaster north come start mess system lifted back front climate leadership.
real danger, need avoid.
right.
friend stop south derbyshire, specifically willington site, already planning permission new gas power station, cut ribbon opens?
want spades ground, welcome announcement.
invite come look site, ready go.
agree.
friend applaud investing system. made one investable countries world clean energy.
gas important part play balance, development carbon capture hydrogen every opportunity assets even longer life green fashion.
would love come see.
friend.
oil gas energy sources past, need intermittent energy source.
gas power plants intermittent.
sit, much renewable energy shut, gas—the carbon energy—continues flow.
reality today: wasting renewable energy.
government recognise reality, respond.
question, however.
many times ministers met representatives oil gas industry, compare number meetings representatives renewables industry?
often—the. lady spectacularly well—she completely utterly wrong.
renewables turned, would say, constraints within system, gas turned system could cope otherwise.
transmission acceleration action plan connections action plan.
[ interruption.]
every time try build infrastructure,.
member angus( dave doogan) opposes.
says scottish national party want friend renewables industry scottish jobs, opposes infrastructure required.
question?
meet representatives oil gas industry lot, truth even given world leadership—and cut emissions major economy planet—75% primary energy today still oil gas.
still dependent oil gas 2050, net zero.
crazy opposition parties, including.
lady, believe opposing licences actually dependent product.
ending licences would lead loss british jobs import higher- emission products abroad.
really hope opposition members think bit deeply hear common sense.
hear corridors back benchers, front benchers.
lady hear nothing nonsense.
welcome policy decision, recognition reality.
minister confirm new plants able convert low- carbon alternatives future?
thank.
friend.
legislating precisely create exactly obligation carbon capture/ hydrogen readiness.
hope decision indicative realisation seems slowly dawning government impact madness net zero policy, damaged economy.
higher electricity prices g7 countries, lost vast numbers jobs energy- intensive industries, recognised intermittency wind solar risk blackouts.
welcome common- sense decision, given going use gas power stations, minister take next logical step legislate allow tap vast gas resources?
shown, would bring prices, give energy security, make economy competitive.
right.
