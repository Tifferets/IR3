government' analysis published yesterday shows 24 gw existing gas capacity could maintained via life extension refurbishment, gw new capacity already baseline existing capacity market arrangements.
uncontroversial position analysis, hardly something worth making huge fuss., secretary state talked yesterday' chatham house conference.
given analysis, could minister enlighten number new gas plants government hoping build, given mention, 500 pages documents published yesterday?
important point, appears show government' intention go beyond already analysis build large number new gas- fired power stations future.
great deal review electricity market arrangements published yesterday worth discussing, least government' glaring failure bring forward low- carbon flexible technologies long- duration storage, everyone knows need.
shame minister properly addressed.
give clarity whether meaningless announcement within existing policy arrangements?, said, attempt conjure culture war climate energy policy, announcements substance value show government serious plan energy country?.
gentleman asked whether new power plants hydrogen carbon capture, utilisation storage ready; legislate make requirement.
asked much; around gw, dependent many interrelated things, growth low- carbon flexible storage,, referred world leader developing supporting innovation capacity market.
suggested none clear yesterday, made crystal clear.
world leader, announced £20 billion ccus.. gentleman remember, around long time, 2003 labour government said carbon capture, utilisation storage urgent route 2050 without, proceeded nothing.
government getting.
putting money mouth developing technologies carbon capture hydrogen, way labour government failed do—as renewables, boot.
talk climate, truth greatest climate risk country right.
member doncaster north( edward miliband) destroys market starts state- run quango, wreck renewables growth seen.
welcome announcement.
independent committee climate change recognises need unabated gas electricity market right 2035 beyond, widely even 2050, 25% energy needs come hydrocarbons.
right.
friend agree exactly right way maintain lower energy production costs, still meeting net zero targets?
agree.
friend.
point wide range back-
capacity, use much fossil fuels,, think long case, ensure new gas generation carbon capture- ready.
look forward hydrogen- ready,.
similar position germany countries looking exactly.
instance, think germany ireland, part growth renewables, recognise need gas, albeit used less less, ensure lights stay appropriate insurance place.
call snp spokesperson.
cluster—it unbelievable situation.
secretary state' letter members today, said government taking steps make sure lights stay.
legacy 14 years conservatives charge energy.
uncomfortably, find agreement right.
member north east somerset( jacob rees- mogg).
significant departure, one alarmed.
government' precious nuclear baseload?
exemplar ccus working necessary scale, government taking inspiration?
would elegant solution unabated gas winding time battery storage long- duration pump storage winding?
cannot, government dragged feet things.
minister say people infrastructure transmission put throughout communities told suck need get gas system, government building gas- fired power stations?.
gentleman, supposed lead subject party, listened said earlier.
2022, 38% generation came gas.
mid-
2030s,%%.?
balance renewables growing, particularly scotland, support scottish jobs.
course put generation scotland demand south, provide connecting infrastructure.
previous generations wire become rich prosperous country today.
need.
working local communities, listening voices making sure misled people come nonsense.
gentleman.
commend right.
friend refreshingly clear articulation strong record area, house today media yesterday.
obviously, security supply must come first.
plans incentivise investment back-
gas- fired power stations, minimising costs consumers, also important?
thank.
friend.
right.
friend member north east somerset( jacob rees- mogg) absolutely right focus economics.
get economics right.
used auction- type mechanism capacity market ensure flexible capacity.
incentivising low carbon, batteries coming scale, well pumps potentially hydrostorage.
also need hydrogen carbon capture.
ensuring balanced system discipline built drive costs.
cbams come stream, firmly expect 2030s lower- cost energy neighbours, right.
friend member north east somerset referred, economically competitive.
call chair energy security net zero committee.
thank, speaker—tapadh leibh.
concerning announced chatham house house, secretary state today.- piste speeches cost past.
committee heard morning energy minister made speech decade ago, effect investment, cost, 000 jobs.
minister says consultation, government picked winner?
room given storage mix?
confusing energy security—we learned ukraine war important is—with continual electricity supply?
given minister says percentage gas used 2030, percentage capacity provide, percentage envisage used day day?
thought given consideration technologies gigawatt demand?
thank.
gentleman question.
