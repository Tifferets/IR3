secondly, based incidents, growing scepticism overall preparedness existing vanguard fleet light allegedly dangerous “rotting” state, referenced dominic cummings, former senior adviser former prime minister.
thirdly, consequence nuclear exposure hazards imposed population scotland lack transparency concerning programme whole, set nation scotland much gain removing nuclear arsenal waters.
first foremost, would like provide factual context debate.
contacted whistleblower coulport armaments depot told emergency evacuation site due radiation leak.
raised matter directly defence secretary, wrote 10 january 2023.
letter, defence secretary denied serious radiation breaches faslane coulport. wrote: “i confirm alleged radiation incident referred defence questions commons occur.
however, public concerns remain relocation staff building 201 rnad coulport building 41.
mod failed confirm date staff coulport building 201 first informed moving building 41.
defence secretary also stated: “no serious radiation breaches occurred majesty' naval base clyde rnad coulport”.
however, response implies threshold reporting radiation leaks.
said time, defence secretary' response raised questions answered.
suggests radiation breaches, fell unqualified serious threshold.
threshold?
defined, risks non- serious radiation breaches?
response parliamentary written question serious radiation breaches clyde coulport ports, minister acknowledged: “there historical events minor radiological consequences majesty' naval base clyde royal naval armaments depot( rnad) coulport. revealed 15 recorded radiation leaks coulport 43 faslane 2023 alone, although mod insists none considered serious.
surely detail events risk present immediate vicinity necessary.
minister commit providing information?
government continue attempts minimise number scale events referring obscure codes categorisations obfuscate risk invoking national security excuse smokescreen?
latter deployed six months ago alba party submitted freedom information request asking many convoys year last five years carrying materials atomic weapons establishment aldermaston royal naval armaments depot coulport.
section 24, national security, section 26, defence, freedom information act 2000 invoked withhold information scotland people—the people frequently placed risk exposure radiation kept dark.
formulaic tests public information versus national interest simply good enough.
would like pointedly ask minister: approximately much nuclear material transported aldermaston coulport last 12 months past five years?
many convoys used, frequency transports?
many workers sufficiently close impacted even low- level nuclear exposure?
need answers, people deserve basic information.
even details potentially catastrophic incidents received media coverage routinely denied right.. members house public alike, spurious grounds ministry comment operational matters respect submarines.
recently reported royal navy nuclear submarine plunged towards crush depth due concerning malfunction main depth gauge.
finally reported last november, incident took place year.
still specifics took place, despite personal request information ministry.
turning preparedness vanguard fleet, september 2023, one vanguard- class submarines returned patrol six months.
defence commentators noted double three- month missions previously completed.
additionally, navy lookout reported returning submarine seemed missing exterior tiles covered marine growth extent seen.
year, life expectancy current vanguard fleet repeatedly extended, despite three four vessels currently seaworthy.
would like credit national newspaper scotland persistent thorough reportage nuclear predicament scotland.
case submarines failing seaworthiness labouring increased operational pressures, indicated malfunctioning vital components, extended periods deployment missing exterior tiles, radiation leaks- reported, ask minister good faith, people scotland right.. members place trust government?
specifically, dreadnought class avoid exactly fate, critically, additional safeguards taken mitigate civilian exposure nuclear contamination, given shocking evidence?
given chief adviser erstwhile prime minister referred' nuclear fleet “horror show”, would hope minister would come degree information transparency, rely merely obfuscation.
brings third final concern.
deficit trust one many reasons people scotland would benefit becoming independent state lieu held union.
“bairns bombs” one galvanising messages independence movement run- 2014 referendum.
slogan embodied persisting sentiment nuclear weapons mass destruction dangerous corrosive impact country planet.
opinion poll opinion poll shows majority scottish people oppose wmds hosted scotland.
whenever independence mentioned government, immediate reaction attempt assert scottish economy better served part.
within realm defence manufacturing, argument far reality possible.
october, government signed contracts totalling £4 billion design manufacture world' advanced submarines.
however much disagree principle- called nuclear deterrent, illustrates perfectly fact scotland receives manufacturing jobs, located barrow-- furness, raynesway derby.
jobs, growth capital yet directed anywhere scotland.
meanwhile, rotting hulks dreadnought subs retired 1980s rusting away rosyth longer service.
