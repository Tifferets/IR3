also support suspension asylum processing; glad government made decision hours called yesterday.
home secretary agree, given asylum claims predicated threat posed individual former president assad, threat gone basis asylum claims therefore gone, would reasonable ask syrians claiming recently granted asylum basis return safe?
earlier today, leader opposition asked prime minister would ensure former residents syria supported murderous daesh regime killed raped innocent women children, persecuted minorities severely persecuted opponents return.
