works explains major flaws draft california state board educations- 12 mathematics instructional framework.
board final hearing today.
science reading instruction, science math instruction.
scientific way teaching math includes: students memorize math facts( like multiplication tables addition subtraction facts) standard algorithms( time- tested math procedures): teaching computational procedures conceptual understanding together( progressives would, concepts procedures); stressing getting answers problems right quickly components math fluency; bearing mind committing math facts procedures long- term memory frees students mind handle novel problems.
instead, progressive- education authors math framework want students learn inquiry self- discovery.
authors give little emphasis mastery facts standard algorithms.
authors want organize math instruction architectonic system increasing abstraction traditionally taught, instead accordance vague, billowy`` big ideas.
educational researcher tom loveless( retired brookings lnstitution) says:`` previous framework clear math fluency involves speed accuracy.
proposed framework rejects speed even part fluency, thats problem.
newly revised framework delays fluency multiplication division tables late elementary school.
delay spill subsequent math learning, loveless believes many students unprepared algebra even ninth grade.
written( co- author, late zeev wurman): framework promotes progressive- education approach teaching math, calling`` student- led instruction,`` active learning,`` active inquiry,`` collaborative instruction.
evidence 1950s recent times shows way teaching math ineffective.
evidence comes scrutinizing carefully designed studies featuring randomized control called quasi- experiments, approximate effect randomized assignment students different groups.
quasi- experiments look cases, example, two adjoining districts similar populations two adjoining similar schools adopt different policies.
sorts studies much stronger evidence case studies progressive educators rely.

evidence best studies, emphasize,`` almost uniformly supports`` full explicit instruction rather inquiry- based approach.
