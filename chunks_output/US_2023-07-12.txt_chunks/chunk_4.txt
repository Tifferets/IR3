brian conrad stanfords math department points revised math framework contains much way`` false misleading descriptions research math instruction.
also cites`` unpublished papers design flaws, instead relying solely peer- reviewed published work.
conrad asks: framework`` still adhere level research quality called works clearinghouse?
conrad says framework invoking neuroscience literature`` misleading ways promote`` pseudo- scientific claims progressive- education math instruction improving pathways brain.
framework wrongly cites paper promote general use`` invented strategies(, students devising strategies) proven approach learning standard algorithms.
conrad finds framework distorts citations way indicates`` ideological( rather evidence- based) opposition acceleration.
points`` extensive literature conclusions opposite cited framework,`` barely ever mentioned.
wurman written: state- adopted education programs recommendations supposed`` research- based.

means consensus strong evidence effectiveness published research.
strong evidence exists, practice broadly recommended.... framework writers wanted solid evidence, would relied final report subgroup reports 2008 federal national mathematics advisory panel.
would made even use federal institute education sciences practice guides, designed teachers curriculum writers.
revised framework rejects( earlier iterations) time- honored aim preparing students take algebra eighth grade.
eighth-
grade algebra policy high- performing foreign countries whose inhabitants compete americas children future-- eighth- grade goal expressly part 1999 2006 california math frameworks.
current framework recommends ninth grade almost students take algebra.
students plan go selective colleges universities plan major stem fields college need pass calculus high school.
taking algebra eighth grade allows.

report earlier draft math framework, conrad says promotion data science classes:`` whatever author responsible myopic view mathematics never involved setting public policy guidance math education.
previously mentioned frameworks opposition acceleration.
also opposes tracking.
conrad points, framework uses`` citation misrepresentations promote`` anti- tracking narrative heterogeneously- grouped classrooms levels.
homogeneously- grouped classrooms allow teachers work effectively without need teach students widely different levels.
students evaluated achievements different subjects placed accelerated classes subjects excel.
avoids misplacements inherent across-- board multi- subject tracking.
framework displays ideological rather empirical opposition ability grouping.
chapter, framework pushes teaching methods math class emphasize radically egalitarian`` social justice goals.
radical egalitarianism ethically dubious, math class math, political indoctrination.
example, current framework contends mathematics used`` understand impact world.
argues math teachers hold political position`` mathematics plays role power structures privileges exist within society support action positive change.
furthermore, according official california framework, teachers use mathematics politically`` analyze discuss issues fairness justice.
elementary school classroom, teachers would, example, students`` studying counting comparing understand fairness context current historical events.
framework recommends fringy methods`` trauma- informed pedagogy, encourage students suggest`` recommendations taking action.
teachers also, says, provide`` curricular examples provide students mathematical toolkit mindset`` identify combat inequities.
according framework, students`` use mathematics highlight inequities.
