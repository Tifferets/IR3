private housing developers come mix.
british designer “grand designs” presenter kevin mccloud wrote last year 15 years' time average profit new build home rocketed £6, 000 £63, 000.
call ministers stand major house builders ensure pay cost putting solar every suitable new roof.
organisation 100% renewable calculated mandatory solar panels heat pumps new homes would add around £8, 000 cost new home—an amount decreases installations gather speed.
clearly, housing developers afford cost, neither anyone else afford consequences meeting solar climate targets.
los angeles wildfires track among costliest history, well heartbreaking, losses already expected exceed £109.
billion.
failing decarbonise speed, line climate science, dwarf cost future- proofing homes.
moral case acting unequivocal, economic one.
ministers worried risk solar costs passed homebuyers, government could simply stop happening.
could also offer interest- free loans technology, make easier retail lenders drive rooftop deployments.
property- linked finance green mortgages help consumers capital costs installation, could regulation incentivise low interest rates green mortgages.
political choices government could make.
sunshine bill solar panels about—forgive me—shining sunlight power.
making every home mini power station would help rebalance power towards communities.
therefore much hope government today choose back solar rooftop revolution mandatory solar included future homes standard, rather choosing protect vested interests behind vast ultimately unsustainable house builders' profits.
thank.
member cheltenham( max wilkinson) introducing bill.
think laudable, heart much right place.
think climate crisis matters policy might contribute government' goal making clean energy superpower.
government, guided excellent work secretary state energy security net zero, already making great strides combating climate crisis, putting green energy heart country' future supporting green industrial growth wherever.
government established great british energy, means need new green infrastructure sooner rather later.
comes specifically solar energy, pleased, within days taking office, government approved three major, long- stalled, large solar farms lincolnshire east anglia, capable generating.
gw, enough power 500, 000 homes.
clear statement intent, one proud.
time, secretary state pledged rooftop revolution, making easier newly built homes come solar panels install solar panels existing homes.
third solar generation capacity already comes rooftop solar, important part energy generation mix know government fully believe rooftop solar,.. member talks lot measures put forward move towards net zero, need go.
cpre hertfordshire says 60% targets could achieved rooftop solar panels alone, supporting bill help make sure revolution helps towards net zero planet people.
thank.
member intervention, cover points shortly.
broadly agree sentiment said.
bill' aims, promoting installation solar panels new homes, feed government' overall intent, pleased.
note, however, undeniable solar farms, especially larger ones, much efficient rooftop solar whole spectrum reasons.
rooftop solar panels constrained size, orientation structural limitations individual buildings, solar farms optimised maximum energy generation.
difference output high 30%.
economies scale mean cost install, maintain centralise supportive infrastructure notably reduces ratio cost per unit energy generated solar farms.
say support rooftop solar, much, solar farms highly scalable, cost-
effective means achieve green energy transition.
exactly point—we need, creates subsidy opportunities rooftop solar panels?
completely agree.
one solution versus another, diverse, broad array solutions, feeding grand, greener future.. gentleman talks balance. view solar better rooftops, pro- solar installations, many thousand acres constituency actively campaigning see turned ground- mounted solar?
must say declare support projects wherever come.
indeed, touch moment.

long felt despite great benefits solar farms bring, often difficult bring forward.
around 15 gw solar energy generation capacity.
germany, meanwhile, solar capacity grew 14 gw 2023 alone.
clear' current planning regime approach building infrastructure constrains growth sees lag behind similar nations.
want clean energy superpower,, leading green energy revolution rather following, must tear barriers growth unlock potential.
constituency, labour colleagues erewash borough council, small, local way, helped part change need.
since taking control council 2023, approved several solar farms, previous conservative administration always blocked, proud colleagues.
