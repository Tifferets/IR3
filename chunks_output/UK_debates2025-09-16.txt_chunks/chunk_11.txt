glad say prime minister' speechwriter, say.
gentleman hope issue come, would undoubtedly embarrassing diplomatically problematic prime minister.
astonishingly, sacked twice misdemeanours, 2004 lord mandelson appointed tony blair european trade commissioner.,, given third chance.
trade commissioner, criticised numerous occasions accepting lavish hospitality companies whose commercial interests process ruling—whether company concerned microsoft, italian shoe producer whatever—which, reason, often involved free luxury cruises.
saw nothing wrong apparently compromising behaviour, category, indeed rather top, association russian oligarch gangster capitalist oleg deripaska.
let clear talking, members probably know much.
deripaska winner battle control russian aluminium industry, battle roughly 100 people murdered.
court reports, interpol documents american government publications, deripaska faced serious allegations murder, bribery, extortion, involvement organised crime.
truly bad man.
grateful right.
gentleman giving way case making.
wonder whether, dealing influence russian oligarchs british politics, opine suitability british political parties accepting donations russians, impact might policies positions.. gentleman last election, would sat chamber, hope, heard opine subjects raise prospective laws deal oligarchs, laws, sadly, government failed carry.
,, backdrop.
deripaska' visa revoked americans 2006, mandelson excuse knowing activities, yet european trade commissioner saw fit accept hospitality deripaska multiple occasions several years, included visiting moscow flown private jet stay dacha siberia private yacht mediterranean—all considering whether give russian aluminium access european market.
deripaska' activities known british security services, briefings available mandelson,,, excuse.
full knowledge dealing.
position mandelson promoted signed concessions russian aluminium companies, ultimately benefited deripaska, companies, tune$ 200 million year.
although actually happen, one company due subject initial public offering—due floated—shortly thereafter.$ 200 million change profits tends mean multibillion- dollar change value, gone pocket deripaska.
know, deripaska nominee putin, assume large chunk went putin well.
2008 mandelson, controversially, raised peerage gordon brown appointed business secretary.
contact epstein end.
epstein pleading guilty child sex offences, mandelson emailed: “i think world feel hopeless furious happened... friends stay love.
little remorse, shall say, little pity victims.
lord mandelson left office labour lost election 2010, founded lobbying firm, global counsel.
controversially, name clients.
house lords rather slack rules, somebody create company declare get however much money company, declare customers really.

context lord mandelson' appointment washington—and bear mind judgment made ambassador washington—it close association organs chinese state raised red flags, house forgive pun.
inter- parliamentary alliance china presented dossier senators, provoked enough concern passed fbi.

appreciate points right.
member making, would note one conservative candidates running milton keynes constituency last general election worked global counsel.
interesting conservatives complaints organisation willing support candidate worked.
going gentle.
let say talking serious issue, national interest engaged, somebody view used public position advantage disadvantage state.
true candidate working junior role company, true man created company used promote interests.
come back inter- parliamentary alliance china, point view—and personal rather political—even worrying attitudes struck mandelson february 2021, lobbying meeting behalf rich clients, told chinese premier li keqiang critics beijing' human rights record would “proved wrong”.
astonishing statement followed later 2021 mandelson labour peer vote—against three- line whip—against genocide amendment would meant country reconsider trade deal country found high court committing genocide, specifically china crosshairs.
frankly, would appear lord mandelson subcontracted conscience money.
right.
friend mentioned inter- parliamentary alliance china.
case house thinks conservative organisation, explain members parties house, 53 countries involved co- chairs left right?
wholly party politics, threat china.
right.
friend exactly right, senators documents sent responsible ones.
would frivolously pass documents fbi, fbi would frivolously accept investigate.
right.
