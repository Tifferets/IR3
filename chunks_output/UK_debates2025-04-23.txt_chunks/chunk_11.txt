appalling state hospital buildings national scandal.
everybody country control lives health, means everybody getting care need need, never realised many patients treating grossly inadequate settings.
shropshire cornwall, cambridgeshire, watford devon, patients losing dignity decisions taken conservatives, labour government' failure rectify.
conservatives' record one starved repair budgets, serious leaks, crumbling ceilings bucket- strewn wards.
outrage millions people waiting treatment, yet overcrowded hospitals close operating theatres longer fit use.
patients hospital staff deserve dignity safe, modern clean environments, instead previous government shamefully chose raid repair budget plug gap day-- day costs, hospitals fell apart, new government, elected increasingly looks like false hope, pursuing false economy delaying desperately needed new hospital programme.
much agenda, government promised much delivering little betraying put faith labour party.
farmers fed tories taking granted hit tax grab families' futures.
employers, promised growth new taxes, whacked national insurance increase.
patients, promised new hospitals, taken away.. lady almost point.
congratulate opening debate.
absolutely true new hospital programme deliver new hospitals unfunded tories.
however, funded labour. money invested local hospitals, imperial college healthcare nhs trust, preparing major rebuilds.
perhaps give new government little credit done, correctly identify shambles left?.
member aware 40 new hospitals—they hospitals 40.
issue start dates work many hospitals need urgent rebuilding pushed back 2030s, long beyond life.
people served hospitals promised new facilities.
devastating communities.
conservative approach contemptible, labour' approach procrastinate.
cost nhs papering cracks keeping hospitals running past natural lifespan enormous.
government must reverse delay new hospital programme urgently deliver new hospitals patients long promised.
wonder.
member explain spending £22 billion extra national health service year way described procrastination.
important recognise additional investment nhs amounts £10 billion year—according office budget responsibility numbers, sure.
gentleman looked at—because cost national insurance hikes compensating public sector employers hikes.
£22 billion figure somewhat misleading.
point making false economy keep buildings going, keep repairing crumbling estate, keep patching putting sticking plaster problems.
buildings need demolished rebuilt, approach false economy.
would much better build new buildings front save future repair costs.
need ensure one treated broken, uncomfortable unsafe facilities.
repairing replacing crumbling, substandard hospitals vital delivering better care treating- patients, crucial rebuilding economy years conservative economic vandalism.
much would cost?
county shropshire, cost maintenance backlog across sites reached £75 million.
sure everyone would agree £75 million lot money—indeed, much total amount government capital investment hospices year—but terms hospital maintenance drop ocean.
