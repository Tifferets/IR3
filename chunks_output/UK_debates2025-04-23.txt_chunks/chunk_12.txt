much would cost?
county shropshire, cost maintenance backlog across sites reached £75 million.
sure everyone would agree £75 million lot money—indeed, much total amount government capital investment hospices year—but terms hospital maintenance drop ocean.
torbay hospital needs £50 million clear backlog, watford hospital backlog £63 million, hull royal infirmary requires eye- watering £70 million.
across england, figure colossal £13.
billion—and bring existing hospital estate minimum standard..
member right huge amount money needs spent.
lot goes back fact, lord darzi tells, £37 billion less spent hospital buildings 2010s necessary.
remind government half 2010s?.
gentleman aware, one comes government clean mess left behind previous government, one make difficult choices.
job opposition point would make choices take different options.
would invest save money long run, rather fritter money away repair bill buildings need demolished.
sensible pour good money bad right thing invest new fit-- purpose modern estate endless extortionate maintenance requirements.
rose— make progress.
north devon district hospital, ducting ventilation system serves operating theatres changed since installed 1979, cannot replaced ceiling height asbestos.
result, operating theatres non- compliant nhs england buildings guidance since 2007.
good people devon clearly need new hospital, promised would one 2030, labour government take away decide change people need delivered another decade.
even hospitals comparatively maintenance problems, royal shrewsbury hospital, serves constituents £35 million backlog, clearly long way short standard.
go detail catalogue issues shropshire—the ambulance delays station closures, waiting times check- ups, scans surgeries, substandard state cancer care—but combine put huge pressure hospitals, staff buildings straining load.
commend.
lady liberal democrats securing debate.
one issue mentioned motion car parking hospitals, ongoing problem disabled people patients miss delay appointments result lack spaces.
agree car parking central addressing issues setting? car parking real problem, particularly public transport poor—it plagues constituents—and unrealistically expensive people need use hospital facilities.

member point.
nhs crisis impacts patient outcomes.
constituent emma left “fit sit” area 48 hours despite diagnosed suspected sepsis, 96- year- old mary waited outside ambulance 11 hours, 82- year- old paula spent 24 hours trolley corridor.
reality hospitals country.
think agree disgrace must rectified..
lady give way?
make progress.
one main reasons problems rectified successive delays successive governments.
shropshire,, prime example.
related new hospital programme, none less, £312 million granted hospital transformation programme shropshire back 2018.
seven years later, country five prime ministers eight different health secretaries, shropshire still waiting transformation take place.
opposition labour conservative councils serve area, along ridiculously lengthy process capital expenditure go signed, means desperately needed improvements horribly delayed construction costs rise.
result, original plans scaled back value diminished..
friend mentions inordinate delays occur regard applications capital funds.
watched horror local hospital trust west hertfordshire submit business case business case watching costs rack.
agree one way spend allocated money efficiently would devolving budgets local hospital trusts, rather centralised programme drives costs? could agree.
exactly situation saw shropshire., people suffer patients.
last year, less £900 million £13.
billion required eradicate repair backlog hospitals invested—just.%.
take accountant work rate, take 15 years clear current backlog, let alone deterioration crumbling buildings.
investment eradicating repair backlog fell sharply £1.
billion 2021 £895 million 2023- 24—a fall 37%.
afraid, like approach fixing social care, government' continued lack imagination ambition leaving nhs less productive less stable, risks leaving millions languishing nhs waiting lists.
rose— give way.
