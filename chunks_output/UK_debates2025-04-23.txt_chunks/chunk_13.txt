pleased.
gentleman' hospital dealt, sure residents torbay feel benefit.
slightly surprised thinks decade since liberal democrats power impact whatsoever.
address point party comes government clear appalling mess left previous government, difficult choices made.
party knows.
labour members, example, voted retain two- child benefit cap keep quarter million children poverty—something one party ever voted.
last time opened liberal democrat opposition day debate october, topic primary care.
explained government' failure invest primary care false economy increased pressures costs critical parts system.
management hospital buildings displays false economy.
spending money critical care instead prevention public health poor approach managing health service, waiting roof collapse irresponsible way manage nhs buildings.
problems ignored investment poorly targeted, patients hard- working staff striving help forced suffer.
new hospital programme.
across country, thousands gp surgeries need urgent improvement provide care patients deserve., 000 hospital buildings across england built foundation nhs 1948, state gp surgeries varies wildly.
many surgeries simply longer fit purpose, built 1950s.
prescott surgery constituency, example, long recognised somewhere needs drastically increase size population village increased drastically.
despite land community infrastructure levy funding available, sign new surgery built.
delay continues, costs rising challenge grows council integrated care board, already immense pressure cut costs.
instead pursuing fantasies like conservatives false economies like labour party, liberal democrats would invest save starting construction, ending epidemic cancelled operations, closed- wards huge sums wasted emergency repairs.
would save taxpayer money long run benefit patients much sooner.. lady little bit unrealistic.
three world- class hospitals constituency: charing cross, hammersmith st mary' paddington.
repair bill £874 million, rebuild new build cost would £4 billion.
yes, refurbishing parts charing cross putting lot investment preparing work, idea suddenly.
lady going come tens, hundreds, billions pounds unrealistic,?
plan put forward involves £10 billion 10 years, come moment.
real issue cannot pick one hospital say indicative nhs dealt appropriately.
hospitals across country falling apart.
example, stepping hill, constituency.
friend member cheadle( morrison), new hospital programme, yet falling apart seams.
need address whole estate fairly urgently.
10- year guaranteed capital investment programme would provide long- term security fix crumbling hospitals creaking gp surgeries.
would provide extra £10 billion crumbling buildings next decade, improving outcomes patients, boosting productivity cutting day-- day costs nhs.
providing certainty crucial.
stands, managers raid precious budgets plug leaking pipes, plug staffing gaps winter pressure arrives.
would also end reactive approach annual winter crisis winter taskforce.
instead average £376 million emergency funding announced late winter year last seven years, winter taskforce would manage ringfenced fund £1.
billion next four years.
would help hospitals plan budgets build resilience wards,& departments, ambulance services patient discharging.. lady talking day-- day budgets nhs, particular costs paying previous debts.
talked work needed done coalition years decade half since, response interventions labour members.
agree one biggest messes needed cleared, still felt nhs budgets, disastrous private finance initiatives blair brown years?
successive failures nhs management parties need hold hands for—that fair point., though, focus task hand rather continually going back decades, either coalition government blair government.
helpful constituents, want solution.
point,.
lady give way?.
generous time going make progress.
also campaigning review outdated government finance rules prevent nhs trusts investing funds raised buildings.
even nhs managers struggle access common- sense investment facilities due overly complex rules glacial processes.
trusts prevented using unspent funds improving buildings.
need root-- branch reform, combined 10- year programme investment, bring local health facilities scratch.
conclusion, recent history nhs one short- term decision making failure successive governments grasp nettle long- term sustained investment things matter: hospital buildings, gp services, dentistry, pharmacy, crucially, unspoken crisis social care.
outcome organisation spending millions pounds go backwards.
truly false economy.
government spoken warmly need reform nhs improve productivity, support, cannot expect retain staff provide high- quality care many doctors nurses negotiating leaking roofs sewage backing wards.
dealing new hospital programme matter urgency, urge secretary state, long last, grasp nettle.
call stephen kinnock—is?
—to move amendment; different name front.
glad recognised chair,.
lost hair since last spoke.
