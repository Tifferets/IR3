questions.
friend member north east bedfordshire( richard fuller) important: huge changes taken place.
new approaches care developed using gold standards framework daffodil standards.
“ambitions palliative end life care: national framework local action 2021- 2026” nhs guidance also led way reforming caring people nearing end life.
gold standards framework registered charity' leading training provider generalist frontline staff caring people last years life 25 years.
aim enable gold standard care everyone condition, setting, given care provider, time person' last years life.
focusing medical side things, bill hopes provide equivalent standard terms pensions.
frameworks integral improvement palliative care greater life expectancy terminally ill patients, better care treatments, longer people live, hence need amendment proposed bill.
one largest issues relating bill clinicians define eligible special rules.
dwp survey showed consensus across groups current definition fit purpose, several reasons.
patients fluctuating conditions uncertain life expectancy found difficult access special rules, life expectancy indeterminable.
many conditions progress rapidly plateau, conditions regularly.
two groups patients struggle motor neurone disease sufferers cancer patients.
preparing today' debate, contacted motor neurone disease association ask feels change affect people diagnosed mnd.
sure everyone house familiar “scrap months” campaign, led jointly mnda marie curie,.

cases, six- month rule forced clinicians patients distressing conversations life expectancy either early wrong time.
two ways issue tackled.
first 12- month rule, bill, mirroring end-- life approach used nhs england.
second taking timescale instead using clinical recommendation supported guidance, explicit timeframe attached it—in effect, looking nature somebody' condition.
first option increase term life expectancy 12 months, bill would.
obviously, approach aligns welfare state work nhs, would make easier organisations across support people nearing end lives understand application special rules, makes consistent.
clinicians many difficult conversations discussing end-- life care, could added conversations instead separately, also saving nhs time.
however, want point time-
bound rule could subject problems, life expectancy fluctuate nothing certain—even within year.
therefore argument basing clinical diagnosis, rather fixed term, definition always going slightly arbitrary.. friend clarify position?
saying would prefer bill amended, happy stands?
grateful right.
friend question.
support bill, far better status quo, sensibly evens situations,.
