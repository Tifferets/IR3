friend member north east bedfordshire would talk fiscal side bill.
contacted tim middleton, director policy external affairs pensions management institute, that—i thank giving time.
two questions must considered financial repercussions policy.
first, many applications full commutation grounds serious ill health received pension protection fund scheme year?
told number double figures—it really many.
say tim middleton working pensions industry since 1987, ever encountered three cases special rule applied pension protection fund scheme, safely say big number.
second question,.
friend member north east bedfordshire rightly asked, application period extended six months 12 months, bill anticipates, additional costs would pension protection fund incur?
member able apply within extended 12 months diagnosis, rather six months, would change.
tim middleton, expert field—of course, government different figures, would delighted hear them— said: “whilst likely increase cost, seem likely would significant,, event, scheme large ppf, expected costs could easily absorbed.
give.
friend comfort scheme burdened beyond means, certainly needs considered.
would helpful minister let know whether assessment one given.
way context, european court justice judgment hampshire case 2018, estimated additional annual cost pension protection fund would £215 million, would affect approximately, 200 members.
bill changes would see nothing like figure.
completeness, looked whether anything countries could usefully included bill, based practices experiences.
comparing terminal illness definitions countries comparable systems, found belgium uses phrase “palliative status”, defined “expected survival maximum months, due one irreversible disorders intention dying home”.
netherlands defines “with expectation die within 12 months”.
australia new zealand use “average life expectancy less years”.
canada, terminal medical condition disease “cannot cured adequately treated reasonably expected result death within months”.
spain refers people “benefit palliative care example, incurable, advanced progressive disease; limited life forecast; low possibility response specific treatments… frequent crisis needs; intense emotional family impact; impact care structure; high demand use resources”.
definitions, see clear international definition constitutes terminal illness purposes welfare system, whether benefit system pensions system.
countries, see, taken time- based approach, others gone clinical definition.
wider area needs consideration generally,.
friend member tewkesbury' bill exactly right make point two systems—the benefit system pension system—should exactly.
absolutely reason.
whatever system future, much hope always able keep consistency approach, otherwise fair.
bill' commencement, right.
friend member east yorkshire absolutely right—to fair,.
friend member tewkesbury set clearly speaking bill, anything hidden—to focus fact measures “come force day days secretary state may regulations appoint.
share concern.
think something good idea, house commons passes bill, house lords, lo behold, nothing happens.
think constituents find intolerable situation.
minister explain must woolly starting point bill?
cannot see need.
specific starting date?
surely, least, “no later than” date—based reasons delay might needed—could inserted.
important minister explains cannot specific date, might delay, cannot “no later than” date added bill.
pretty sure want consider either committee subsequent stages.. friend examined clause(), gives secretary state power make transitional arrangements, nine- month period could introduced specific time.
understand giving government flexibility.
house place approve bill, monarch signs, become law implemented.
right.
friend makes good point.
one duty members scrutinising legislation holding government account ensure day like today, people anxious get much possible, government sneak bill powers change things easily future—powers perhaps house might otherwise want give.
moment, house passes far many things give government day sweeping powers change things without coming back house meaningful scrutiny.
right.
friend absolutely right wary measures.
fairly short bill, extensive part clause, basically gives government powers vary, introduce measures want,.
always nervous legislation convenience executive rather benefit constituents.
incumbent minister explain government need powers.
specific reason powers added bill, typical catch- all—“let' shove lot case might need point future”?
always wary measures.
good reason subsection clause needed, let hear make minds.
needed shoved bit convenience case powers needed later date, perhaps house might want say, “well, don’t think powers.
want something different, come back later date make case.
look forward hearing minister' response.
perhaps things could come back bill' remaining stages, meantime, certainly support thrust.
