definition “terminal illness” disease reasonably expected bring end somebody' life within six months.
department work pensions used definition calculating benefits, social security( special rules end life) act 2022, six months extended 12 months.

determining length time someone live falls health professionals, heartbreaking difficult judgment make.
modern medicine, surgery palliative care—such provided excellent sue ryder hospice constituency—and general care provided nhs staff make judgment even difficult.
therefore feel right extend definition “terminally ill” narrow band six months accommodating threshold 12 months.
fairer people ill, make difficult judgment—a judgment especially difficult health professionals make know person' pension payments may rest.
