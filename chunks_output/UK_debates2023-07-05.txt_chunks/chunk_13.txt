recently, government' blueprint future energy mix, “powering britain”, published april, clearly sets plan diversify, decarbonise domesticate energy production investing renewables nuclear.
last two years, welsh affairs committee undertaken several inquiries different aspects energy policy infrastructure, relate wales.
one might ask welsh affairs committee taking interest energy, simply immense importance energy wales welsh economy.
wales consumer energy, primary producer gateway energy imports exports.
furthermore, recognise potential economic opportunities could accrue wales future developments renewable energy nuclear energy.
completed initial wide- ranging inquiry renewable energy july 2021, committee pursued three subjects greater detail: grid capacity wales; nuclear energy wales; floating offshore wind., acutely conscious fact none particularly niche specific wales.
indeed, much evidence heard subjects direct read- across regions nations.
time available, would like touch briefly key outputs three inquiries highlight ongoing challenges.
commend right.
gentleman bringing debate forward.
chair welsh affairs committee, talking wales, also mentioned benefit area.
three options put forward tidal energy, could northern ireland?
feel comes bringing forward strategy house today, happens wales england, scotland northern ireland?
happens collectively, benefit.
therefore, strategy come place, must driven regions great northern ireland collectively.
ever,.
gentleman correct: one.
course, energy island ireland interconnections republic, changing nature energy system, economic opportunities investment, job creation industrial renewal enormous parts uk—for northern ireland, wales, england scotland.
wish touch briefly key outputs three inquiries mentioned.
first, grid capacity, talking network power lines, pylons interconnectors transport electricity generated areas demand.
critical piece energy infrastructure puzzle, wales, parts.
issue keep ministers awake night, clear inquiry entire way grid enhancements new connections delivered fit purpose, given imperatives energy policy.
recognise steps taken government national grid electricity system operator.
appointment nick winser' first electricity networks commissioner, government taking steps address challenges.
however, think increase speed delivery consenting required see renewal national grid way need years ahead, see need much significant step change pace activity.
rose— give way chairman select committee energy security net zero.
right.
gentleman makes good point.
one issue address plethora zombie projects clogging system, make easy anybody.
identifying easy either—i pretend, wanted bring attention.
grateful.
gentleman bringing house' attention.
currently 200 gw projects books.
many zombie projects, describes, come fruition clogging system.
government need somehow get rid projects order focus areas know investment, encourage anticipatory investment approach deliver new infrastructure need timely way.
otherwise, end developing renewable technology system able generate clean energy, grid get needed.
secondly, nuclear energy, inquiry confirmed broad consensus government welsh government role nuclear play achieving' net zero targets ensuring domestic energy security.
majority witnesses favour new nuclear energy generation wales, pleased say committee agreed nuclear energy strong role play mix low- carbon sources.
pay tribute.
friend member ynys môn( virginia crosbie) role played committee, well capacity constituency mp, championing nuclear energy ynys môn.
energetic active member
ynys
môn remember—she done great job championing constituency.
report carries reflects much positivity.
friend brought subject.
heard strong evidence suitability wylfa site ynys môn new gigawatt- scale reactor.
fact, believe government meet targets increasing nuclear power without building large- scale nuclear plant wylfa.
recognise progress government made establishing great british nuclear bringing forward regulated asset base model securing investment new nuclear.
however, despite positive progress, new nuclear power station wylfa north wales bag.
government 10 years ago, championed new nuclear power station wylfa.
ministers sent photo opportunities meet potential investors, happen.
know
community ynys môn, represented.
friend, feels disappointment hopes raised dashed past.
want happen, implore minister hear arguments wylfa.
know feels passionate subject discuss issues government colleagues.
witnesses point eye- wateringly high cost new nuclear, well painfully slow process, given amount time take running?
best world, unlikely new big nuclear power station early 2030s.
given government' target decarbonise electricity supply 2035, nuclear unable play much part helping achieve..
lady makes good point.
investment large- scale nuclear, even small modular reactors, longer- term feature energy system, government' “powering britain” report recognised.
fact, government' targets increasing nuclear 2050, 2030.
cost nuclear, yes, points made committee.
