investment large- scale nuclear, even small modular reactors, longer- term feature energy system, government' “powering britain” report recognised.
fact, government' targets increasing nuclear 2050, 2030.
cost nuclear, yes, points made committee.
made sure evidence session hear friends earth others opposed nuclear per se. heard strong arguments belief energy system entirely comprising renewable power storage technology future, also heard strong evidence technology yet exist.
stay real world, nuclear, tried tested long term provider cheap reliable power, important part future energy mix, conjunction energy sources.
going make similar point made.
member brighton, pavilion( caroline lucas).
right.
gentleman talking relying future technologies, smrs future technologies—he admitted use technology exist moment.
much estimate one large- scale new nuclear plant cost, much would fleet smrs cost, come fruition?
going disappoint.
gentleman, specific figures pile notes brought.
however, figures evidence.
right small modular reactors technology future testing still required, work going, countries.
technology future, point putting heads sand wilfully pretending otherwise.
believe technology future, lot depend future costs.
particularly estimates day, really “putting heads sand” technology simply expensive?
considering government expenditure, looking technology produces clean energy least expensive, expensive?
evidence considered took entire life cycle nuclear power station.
looking energy produced 30, 40, 50 years shows give secure, reliable base load affordable energy production.
people oppose nuclear per se persuaded cost efficiency technology; persuaded.
