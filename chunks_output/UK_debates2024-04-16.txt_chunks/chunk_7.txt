recently, seen european countries wean russian oil gas.
cannot, become dependent parts world energy needs.
plan give british supply chains time develop, ensuring british workers reap benefits energy transition.
according expert analysis, labour plans cost taxpayers £100 billion—all undermine british manufacturing risk blackouts.
secretary state aware, environmental audit committee inquiry decarbonising economy heard evidence newly commissioned nuclear capacity—even small modular reactors—is able come stream 2035.
new energy projects given planning consent today unlikely connect grid 2030, scale necessary grid network roll- reach 2035 target already huge.
right.
friend make feasibility, let alone cost highlighted today, fantasy pipe dream official labour party policy decarbonise 2030?
thank right.
friend question.
plans set represent largest expansion nuclear 70 years, radical reforms grid.
however, take time build things.
labour' 2030 policy mad, bad downright dangerous.
yet meet serious expert single person industry believes possible.
record proud, becoming first major economy halve emissions, labour' plans would heap costs taxpayers, stark contrast pragmatic proportionate approach.
grid decarbon- isation 2030 really cost billions pounds secretary state claims, might care explain policy achieve 95% full decarbonisation date.
knows independent analysis actually says labour' plan would reduce families' energy bills £300 year, ’fess?
admit true price failure paid hard- pressed families energy bills?
would completely reject, based many conversations industry experts.
plans set assessed climate change committee realistic.
plans labour party set criticised pretty much every single part energy system.
rather playing politics issue,.
gentleman consider reality taxes, raised bills problems economy labour' plans would force.
last year, government promised would publish decarbonisation plan end 2023, failed.
secretary state embarrassed admit truth?
way track, even delivering clean power 2035, bungled offshore wind auction, failing energy efficiency refuses end onshore wind ban.
case wants attack labour' plan cannot defend?
thank.
lady, extraordinary question.
would much credibility labour party would recognise first country g20—the 20 largest economies—to halve emissions.
labour members might play politics issue, absolutely happy defend position dealing climate change obligations pragmatic way protects household finances.
whether made assessment potential merits public ownership energy system.
properly regulated markets, incentivise private capital invest energy system, provide best outcome consumers promote market competition best driver efficiency, innovation value.
despite minister' disagreement, public ownership exists energy system.
example, 45% offshore wind assets publicly owned, uk—they belong state- owned companies countries denmark norway.
publicly owned energy companies accelerate transition clean energy creating jobs, reducing bills ensuring public benefit directly common resources.
countries leading transition renewables realised; minister?
thank. member.
flattering: 48 hours role, would like upgrade personally charge delivering energy companies.
gently remind local authority nottingham city council, robin hood energy, chaired politician—the public probably want fewer,, us—managed cost taxpayers staggering £38 million.
assessment made potential impact number oil gas licences issued department level carbon emissions imported liquefied natural gas.
north sea transition authority analysis shows producing natural gas domestically almost four times cleaner importing liquefied natural gas abroad.
without continued licensing, dependence imported oil gas, including lng, increase quickly future.
always fan fully exploiting natural resources.
got take pragmatic route cutting carbon emissions, forefront thinking must also driving energy costs, boosting energy security anything enfeebles country global stage.
minister agree right approach terms energy costs importing much liquefied natural gas also make carbon footprint smaller?
completely agree.
friend' analysis.
utilising domestic resources common sense alternative import fuels abroad.
would act self- sabotage put restrictions domestic sector, damaging jobs investment liquefy ship gas halfway around world create emissions process.
welcome minister post, know gas imports lng actually come via pipeline norway, gas production half polluting.
new oil gas would disastrous climate; would also fail boost energy security.
following welcome announcement finally withdraw energy charter treaty, government also reverse decision license rosebank oil field, cost climate public purse extremely dear?
thank.
member kind comments.
scale clean energy success, including renewables, gone% 40%, still need oil gas.
failure issue new licence would make difference consumption oil gas, would increase imports, typically higher emissions, also damage economy.
whether plans support offshore energy grids.
