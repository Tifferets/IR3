government accept difficult deter terrorist fanatics, one mainly contain effectiveness ultimately destroyed, preferably regional allies?
secretary state feel fact link separate conflict, conflict ukraine?
coincidence proxies russia' ally middle east much active russia desperate turn attention away supporting ukraine?
ever, right.
friend absolutely hit nail head.
russia iran working together.
actually, kind drones—sometimes shahed drones—that fired ukraine russians, courtesy iran, also fired houthis.
makes excellent linkage point, absolutely right.
call snp spokesperson.
people scotland elsewhere islands deserve know plan crisis red sea—not timings, detail missions, tactical ambition resources behind, broad strategy pursued lethal force name absence parliamentary approval.
already made clear snp benches support government international partners direct action uphold freedom navigation law sea, never taken granted remains subject realistic interpretation self- defence imminence.
see toll russia' illegal invasion ukraine taken constituents businesses energy costs, cannot allow compounded interrupting global supply chains, ever tolerate stand idly seafarers put risk, whatever supposed aims houthis backers may.
sustained engagement?
know, neither rest.
one way another, allied seaborne strike capability engaged, one two aircraft carriers royal navy commission, type 23 frigate fleet knees, type 43 destroyer fleet still going pip—the power improvement project—who government grip royal navy' resources?
fundamentally, government' plan ensure campaign escalatory, thinking behind assessment made?
closing, supporting gazans, people dying fleeing persecution gaza, houthis pursuing aims.
however, would interested know government' assessment uptick temperature middle east—in gaza, yemen nato ally personnel killed.
listening carefully.
gentleman, detect supports action taken.

think quite clear strong support house.
also important sufficient freedom action ensure safety security airmen women undertake actions, rather flagging substantially advance.. gentleman mentioned—and right.
member wentworth dearne( john healey) —the aircraft carrier, address point.
case, actually abundance caution final inspection, decision taken aircraft carrier sail.

wonder whether secretary state seen front page financial times today outlines iran using lloyds santander accounts evade sanctions.
accusing front companies funding irgc hundreds millions dollars working russian intelligence raise money iranian proxies.
sure house would appalled know money laundered capital used troops houthis, assessment government made allegations ally?
yet show must proscribe irgc?
issue repeatedly raised house.
lady know, heard responses many times, routinely comment proscription.
case however sanction, sanctioned entirety irgc already, well taken number different actions.
appreciate matter come directly within defence portfolio, know opportunity press foreign office home office ministers future time, keep matter constant review.
agree secretary state government want see escalation region want proportionate response calibrate response provoke antagonise, case might actually hitting wrong target—that hitting proxies iran, believe peace diplomacy, malevolent factor region,, iran?
