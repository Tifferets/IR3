brain tumours biggest cancer killer children adults age 40, yet recent years, glioblastoma apportioned around%% cancer funding.
2018, honour dame tessa jowell, government announced doubling funding research brain tumours, six years later, widely reported less half pledged £40 million actually spent.
years, funding delayed sluggishly deployed,, 000 people diagnosed glioblastomas.
government update house remaining funds spent?
minister assure national cancer plan developed alongside nhs 10- year plan, deliberate specific consideration given glioblastomas?
medicines healthcare products regulatory agency incentivises research orphan drugs, granting exclusivity manufacturers making cheaper bring drugs market developed, clearly, comes glioblastomas, adequate success.
see mhra numerous times asked repurposed drugs.
many pharmaceutical companies worried repurposing drugs; fear glioblastoma research affect main cause drug, might make drug less successful.
beseeched mhra treat glioblastoma separately.
would.
lady support move?
would course support move, urge government listen take action.
getting right glioblastoma vital.
despite minor breakthroughs, exciting innovations apparently promising research leads, disease, simply improvement survival rates cancers.
put bluntly, glioblastoma remains death sentence—an increasingly common one., cancer diagnoses increased, although worrying sub- themes, trend largely due increased life expectancy.
however, case glioblastoma.
past 30 years, rates doubled.
far uptick attributable living longer.
people developing disease, yet failed make meaningful strides treatment cures, even giving glioblastoma little time dearest.
moment something.
welcome bill.
welcome emphasis improving research—i already touched drug development—and provisions facilitate clinical trials, grim reality glioblastoma, trials hard conduct.
patients, frequently life expectancy limited.
anything done connect eligible patients researchers faster less friction valuable.
emphasise great opportunities front accelerating research making broad advances battle rare cancers.
along almost half parliamentary colleagues, proud pledged support lobular moon shot project, advocates boost around £20 million five years research basic biology invasive lobular breast cancer, view developing new treatments.
despite second common form breast cancer, lobular breast cancer many ways treated like rare cancer.- researched, difficult diagnose standard screening mammogram, often presents fewer symptoms invasive ductal carcinoma, makes overwhelming majority breast cancer incidents..
lady explaining well, invasive lobular breast cancer classed rare cancer.
concerned would come within scope bill, gently ask could widened next stage.
says, lobular breast cancer many characteristics rare cancer.
thank.
gentleman intervention.
yes, lobular breast cancer treated many ways like rare disease.
recently met constituent kate, diagnosed lobular breast cancer 2023.
explained almost breast cancer research based ductal variant, women like diagnosed later often receive treatment oriented towards cancer different biology lobular cancer.
two factors result higher recurrence lower survival rates.
kate remission year, become advocate research.
behalf, ask minister whether met lobular moon shot campaigners.
steps government taking increase research cancer?
consideration given updating guidelines national institute health care excellence encourage use mris diagnose lobular breast cancer earlier?
moon shot idea right one.
fighting cancer set ambitious goals, innovate meet.
moreover, apollo project shows, research seemingly narrow things often spillover effects, producing vast, unanticipated benefits.
often true comes orphan drugs.
take one example, gleevec changed game, one rare form leukaemia; used treat range cancers conditions.
british pharmaceutical development sector exceptionally strong, moment potential.
genome mapping, artificial intelligence, biotech, immunotherapy cancer vaccines, position transform save lives.
recognise limited scope bill, believe vital.
house must take keen interest accelerating incentivising research rare cancers, including glioblastoma.
legislation meaningfully advances goal.
speak briefly young people children, specifically lovely girl called maddie cowey.
age 18, maddie diagnosed alveolar soft part sarcoma.
sarcoma uncommon cancer occur anywhere body.
cancers someone maddie' age considered rare, case, classification ultra- rare.
partly consequence, took five months receive diagnosis.
maddie started university.
recalled time “felt like life falling apart.
many ways.
lonely place.
maddie diagnosed almost 10 years ago.
approved treatments maddie' type rare cancer, undergoing clinical trial.
likely remain treatment life.
maddie amazing; brave let cancer define.
bring story cancer young people uncommon often diagnosed later.
neither medical professionals young people expect, later diagnosis comes, likely cancer lethal.
steps government taking ensure rare cancers afflicting young people caught earlier?
finally, reminded something emily dickinson wrote hope: “i’ve heard chillest land, strangest sea”.
must get right.
