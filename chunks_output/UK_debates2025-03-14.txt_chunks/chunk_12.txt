argue favour today, using three examples: first, story constituent suffering rare cancer; secondly, importance bill extremely rare cancers;, lastly, importance future research.
many rare forms cancer individuals suffer, often without specialised treatments public awareness, every rare cancer patient name story.
take constituent recently met event world cancer day, suffers- cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia.
although five- year survival rate leukaemia currently stands 55%, figure acute myeloid leukaemia, rare aggressive form, one lowest cancers.
22% survival rate beyond five years diagnosis.
means, sadly, nearly 80% diagnosed aml today survive end.
