member bath( wera hobhouse), person needs refuse food.
evidence jurisdictions around world, jurisprudence, shows would enough qualify someone assisted death.. gentleman accept every day nhs patients refuse treatment, indeed food, currently legal oversight respect coercion matters?
would bill strengthen protections areas?
perplexed argument.
suggestion may coercion—of course be—and abuse, sorts injustices take place current system, strike argument regulating licensing assisted suicide.
concerns practice nhs, let deal.
let license suicide—and, way, evidence around world shows increases suicide general population.
suicide contagious.
instance, oregon often pointed example.
incidence suicide, outside assisted suicide laws, risen third since legalised.
would enormous contagious effects regulate license way..
gentleman making excellent case bill passed today.
actually saying specifics require debate, analysis discussion great detail committee—that whole point.
dealt properly committee, pass third reading.
suggesting like specifics, cannot discuss bill detail.
sure.
member spen valley delighted support.
gentleman.
refer point making: inappropriate process.. friend making superb speech, expected.
issue process, say.
member boston skegness( richard tice), constituency neighbour: know, introduced serious bills, including one became investigatory powers act 2016.
preceded three independent reports pre- legislative cross- party scrutiny houses, happened committee stage.
point process take place second reading,.
grateful right.
friend.
run process taking interventions. explained, pretty much anybody serious illness disability could work qualify assisted death bill.
members may think far- fetched, happens everywhere assisted suicide legal, including oregon.
point order,.. gentleman using incorrect language.
suicide.

point order.
sorry offence given, fact value bill black white seeing law really.
bill would amend suicide act 1961.
would allow people assist suicide first time.
respect.
lady' concern, afraid need use proper language.
bill' scope broad.
members think assisted suicide people anorexia conditions would regarded terminal could happen consider young people today given diagnosis terminal anorexia put palliative care pathway—essentially, assigned death.
course extreme cases— rose— going give way.
great many cases, afraid, mention show wide open bill.
[ interruption.]
order. may ask.
member bath( wera hobhouse) keep little calmer?
intervened twice already, plenty members also need heard.
think particularly disabled people, many require constant treatment stay alive., immediately definition, eligible terms bill state- sponsored death.
refer members equality human rights commission, made point line disability terminal illness blurred.
bill' title, fact, dangerous.
rose— make little progress.
second question medical practitioners answer mental capacity, great vagueness.
judge someone right mind asking help kill?
bill says definition capacity based mental capacity act 2005, act deliberately expansive.
explicitly assumes capacity patient, acute depression bar judged capacity act.
suicidal bar act, capacity test bar.
finally, question coercion.
patient asking assisted death pressure someone else?
two glaring problems.
first process even attempt answer question properly.
investigation, requirement medics interview friends family, need psychiatrist family consulted.
medics need satisfy themselves—who knows?
—that, best knowledge, person pressured.
second problem coercion test focuses one type coercion—the less likely type.
bigger danger people pressuring someone; pressure themselves—hon.
members made point.
bill nothing say.
internal pressure absolutely fine. feel worthless burden others, nhs offer treatment need, local authority make adjustments need home, wait long hospital appointment, want die think system failed, absolutely fine.
rose— get end speech.
medical stage, jump straight judicial stage.
medical practitioners sign, judge confirm tests.
course, many eminent judges made point overwhelm family courts test applied properly, applied properly, bill assumes judges fulfil new inquisitorial role actually look cases investigators, entirely unknown english common law.
bill require actual investigation.
requirement judge even meet applicant.
simply phone call, maybe email, one medics.. inquiry.
basis, judge must decide whether likely external pressure.
judge approves it—they required approve, unless find evidence external coercion—we go “the final act”, bill says, junior colleague, medical practitioner, oversees death pills lethal injection.
last thing bill.
requirement stage process—at either medical judicial stage—for anyone tell patient' next kin, wider family even gp nhs judicial system working secret bring death loved one, maybe father daughter.
