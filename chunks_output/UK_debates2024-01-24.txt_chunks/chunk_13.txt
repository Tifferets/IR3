despite enormous benefits cars bring constituents' families land, indeed, people across world, many motorists, world seems filled councillors officials dedicated making lives difficult.
driving becoming minefield potential traps penalties, drivers becoming paranoid resentful entire system.
happens, order tends break, time come rebalancing.
bill, propose three modest measures would achieve better balance would hopefully see better results generally motorists members communities across board.
