last year conducted completed work.
commend statement house.
grateful secretary state advance sight statement receipt earlier morning hard copy rimmer review.
also thank secretary state minister armed forces briefing yesterday parliamentary colleagues today.
furthermore, given nature super- injunction fact timing nature statement relate entirely court' lifting super- injunction, recognise entirely right secretary state update house earliest opportunity, welcome opportunity colleagues scrutinise matters.
let begin declaring interest.
defence minister august 2023, department first became aware breach, main role chair one meeting matter august 2023 duty minister.
thereafter, however, minister defence procurement sitting outside portfolio, relatively minimal direct involvement.
said, secretary state issued apology behalf government join, recognising data leak never happened unacceptable breach relevant data protocols.
also agree right apology issued specifically whose data compromised.
nevertheless fact cannot ignored breach came light, immediate priority government avoid specific terrible scenario: namely, error part official british state leading torture, even murder, persons dataset hands remains brutal taliban regime.
rimmer review confirms, scenario, thankfully, appears avoided.
course, understand review set january reported secretary state june.
want clear entirely appropriate secretary state sought update department' understanding threat ground afghanistan exists today, particularly persons dataset previously considered greatest risk reprisals.
however, house appreciate ministers became aware data breach august 2023, luxury six months assess situation.
rimmer says paragraph 53: “the review notes passage time particularly relevant.
know former ministerial colleague—the former minister armed forces, james heappey, led response leak—will focused entirely saw duty care risk reprisals, based threat assessment pertained time.
however, threat picture constantly evolving, say, support secretary state' decision review mod' understanding threat.
given latest situation, reported rimmer, support conclusion afghanistan response route closed.
turning super- injunction, entirely understand would subject considerable interest, particularly newspapers media outlets concerned.
independent judiciary, comment either decision grant injunction first place lift today, surely telling paragraph 56 rimmer review planning time government became aware breach summer 2023 based “risk judgement taleban secure access dataset, consequences affected individuals may serious.
case, doubt court would less likely grant injunction, certainly super- injunction.
leak, secretary state confirm civil servant, ministers time took steps change casework procedure using spreadsheets sent email, moving secure system fully within entirely secure network?
confirm, although dataset 18, 000, relatively small portion identified high risk reprisals, small number settled,, stated, cost £400 million, £7 billion reported elsewhere?
matters rightly public domain given reassessment threat rimmer review, agree would wholly appropriate defence committee others look matters.
secretary state comment one specific item reported, someone—i refer person made leak, another apparent third party obtained data—was engaged blackmail?
original metropolitan police investigation look,, consider reopening police look specific point, serious implications?
although must recognise huge role played afghan nationals support armed forces, policy area must always balanced national interest.
support government closing arr scheme, decision close full arap programme.
welcome tone shadow defence secretary responded, welcome joining apology behalf british government whose data compromised.
also welcome acceptance, put, “entirely appropriate” defence secretary, part new government, look update department' assessment threat.
pleased, house noted, supports rimmer' conclusions policy judgments government announced today.
shadow defence secretary right, simple terms, rimmer gives revised,-- date assessment risk—in particular, risk individuals whose data may spreadsheet.
confirm highly unlikely name dataset increases risk targeted.
shadow defence secretary asked three four specific questions.
asked official—it defence official.
cannot account improvements data handling previous ministers may made, job opposition, data leak one many afghan schemes.
also say, past year since election, government appointed new chief information officer, installed new software securely share data completed comprehensive review legacy afghan data casework system.
£7 billion figure, think shadow defence secretary may picked court papers, previous estimate.
related simply afghan response route estimate total cost government afghan schemes entire period may operate.
significance today' announcement policy decisions taken compared simply continuing policy schemes inherited, taxpayer pay £1. billion less period,, 500 fewer afghans come country,, proper accountability house proper freedom media restored.
call chair defence committee.
