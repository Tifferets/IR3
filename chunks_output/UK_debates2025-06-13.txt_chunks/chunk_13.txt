heated debate,.
members sides house feel strongly.
grateful members came, made place possible spoken powerfully movingly debate, believe—and evidence shows—that colour skin belong discussion bill.
rise speak amendment() new clause 15, tabled name, hope.
members support.
although may seem technical, fact simple amendment significant impact.

like many.
members, deeply concerned outset bill drafted, workability, impact nhs lives vulnerable people country.
clear, view one unintended death result bill becoming law one many.
humbly ask.
members still considering position, minded support bill, consider point amendment carefully: acceptable error rate?
based figures government' impact assessment, think underestimates impact, even% error rate would see minimum 13 wrongful deaths year, 45 per year year 10.% error rate would see 65 deaths year 227 year 10. 10% error rate would see 131 deaths year 455 year 10.
say, think low- ball estimates, nevertheless chilling.
law passed, exceptionally difficult say whether errors instances abuse;, least, errors picked fraction true picture, tragically would testify fact already dead.
amendment() new clause 15 directly addresses issue.
england wales, coroner investigate death certain legal conditions met.
duty primarily governed section coroners justice act 2009.
judge thomas teague kc, served 2024 chief coroner england wales, notes: “any death arising consequence ingestion administration lethal substance constitutes unnatural death local coroner statutory duty investigate”.
clearly, assisted dying meets definition, right deaths afforded best possible posthumous judicial scrutiny.. lady feel provisions bill already safeguards?
also, importantly, feel putting family coronial process death expected unfair, unjust completely beyond bounds coroners meant?
first point, believe bill strong enough stands.
second point, already dealing fact families even guaranteed knowledge loved one assisted death, think.
lady' point entirely considered.
stands, bill would disapply duty coroner investigate case assisted death carried accordance bill' provisions.
new clause 15, specifically, would amend coroners justice act clarify assisted death constitute “unnatural death” purposes act.
think takes extraordinary leap imagination conceive deliberately self- administering lethal drugs anything unnatural death.

state get things wrong; professionals get things wrong—and, proven, clear path wrongdoing identified, try ensure occur.
thank. friend.
statistics quoted earlier pretty clear point makes.
let make progress.
work undertaken coroner box- ticking exercise bureaucratic hurdle.
context assisted dying, extremely powerful deterrent abuse malpractice., quote judge thomas teague kc, letter times may year, said removal “any realistic prospect effective inquest... would magnify, rather diminish, obvious risks deception undue influence”.
thank.

share concern removal coroner, stated clearly royal college pathologists, speaks amendment?
thank.
member come point soon.
make progress; take interventions.
struggle see removing automatic oversight assisted deaths squares commitment enact legislation “strongest safeguards world”., bill sets lower bar scrutiny review, creates information deficit.
put another way, simply know know.
implementing novel piece legislation without ensuring robust possible scrutiny deaths taking place act astonishing. bill, assisted deaths would outlier, intentionally procured death would automatically reviewed coroner.
