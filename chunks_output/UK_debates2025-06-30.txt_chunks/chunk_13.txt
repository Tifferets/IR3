agree welfare system needs reform many place believe changes disability support take place without listening disabled people' voices experiences.
last days, hopeful government shown strength listening moving heard.
however, question sequencing.
logic making changes future claimants finishing timms review, co- produced disabled people?
could lead two tiers three: existing claimants; new claimants, lose; post timms review claimants?, correct.
set statement, existing claimants pip protected.
reason making changes future claimants want start focus, future claimants, higher needs.
current claimants pip universal credit health top-, one pushed poverty result changes bill.
health sickness benefit spending set hit £100 billion end, secretary state bringing forward proper reforms rather rushed cuts imposed chancellor save £2 billion, duck difficult decisions deal scale challenge face?
perhaps.
member make point front bench, 14 years.
welcome clarity right.
friend set, particularly existing pip claimants severe conditions, constituents met weekend want active part designing changes affect.
confirm constituents able feed direct lived experience pip review?
yes; set statement, intend co- produce timms review disabled people, organisations represent, experts mps,.
friend' constituents absolutely able feed views review.
want strike right balance, co- production takes time.
want quickly possible, done effectively possible.
look forward working.
friend involving constituents' views.
spoke resident—a friend—in constituency weekend.
wheelchair user since failed back operation years ago.
currently gets pip.
gets three points dressing undressing two points washing bathing.
needs help, yet fears,, anybody exact needs applying next november left without help.
right,, concerned fear?
unjust uncaring, isn’t?
repeat.
gentleman common benefit system protect existing claimants new rules rates.
also say putting billions pounds extra nhs people get health social care support need.
putting place biggest-
ever employment support investment sick disabled people know disabled people work twice likely poverty.
investment making.
constituents protected put poverty result changes bill.
thank secretary state commitment bring forward stronger bill, working colleagues across house.
reality one house could become disabled—disability discriminate.
important recognise network informal care keeps social care system going.
reality number carers would eligible carer' allowance without pip eligibility, many carers receive carer' allowance poverty.
people money; want help loved one family friend.
know personal experience, carer mum, toll takes help someone bathe, get bed, cook clean.
people money, scared.
secretary state confirm protect carers future pip changes
right carers pushed poverty?.
friend huge champion issues, long championed unpaid family carers.
says, many even think carer; husband, wife, son, daughter, mum dad looking person love.
want reassure, said statement, existing pip claimants get passported benefits, like carers, protected result changes made.
indeed, know right.
friend health secretary wants far support family carers future without, nhs would collapse.
secretary state agree, necessary time covid, removal requirement face-- face assessments opening door potential abuse?, commit principle reinstatement face-- face assessments?
exactly committed green paper.
presumably, outcome timms review require form primary legislation enact changes system come department work pensions.
case, suggest minister removing clause bill tomorrow putting future legislation means department still thresholds future wants, everybody knows criteria judgments made.
co-
producing review, may result changes require primary secondary legislation action, want pre- empt.
let bring.
friend house back purpose changes: ensure system fair need support fair taxpayers, try put welfare state sustainable footing future.
, real fear people really, really need support going forward.
today' statement feels like panicked political fix indefensible attempt cut benefits sick disabled people, lacks competence compassion.
given secretary state talks social justice, justify people might need support future receiving support disabled sick people rightly receive today?
would right thing shelve proposals allow time promised genuinely co- produce consult disabled people right way forward?
fundamentally disagree.
gentleman' proposition.
changes rooted clear principles work work need support, cannot work protected, need system fair sustainable.
believe wait disabled people country want work denied opportunities.
cannot system one eight young people education, employment training, terrible long- term consequences brings.
cannot see one 10 fellow citizens trapped work economically inactive, good future country.
already know bill published flawed, changes made past days announced today.
