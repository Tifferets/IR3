pay tribute.
member dudley( sonia kumar) excellent maiden speech.
indeed, heard half dozen excellent maiden speeches today, several touched climate crisis future children country, themes relate amendment.
touched hear passion new members spoke experiences commitments.
amendment requires obr report impact fiscally significant measures announced government' statutory net zero target.
justification amendment simply cannot separate economy climate—they interlinked.
deliver green economic transformation urgently need, referenced.
members speaking earlier, every single policy must aligned' net zero target every government spending decision well.
makes sense increase obr' remit net zero specifically consider impact climate risks economic stability, far policies introduced fiscal events reduce increase risks.
fiscal events, namely budgets spending reviews, lock happening economy years come, even generations, beggars belief properly taking account climate impacts.
whether policies spending new roads, subsidies tax breaks oil gas, investment renewables infrastructure giveaways like freeze fuel duty, direct impacts' prospect meeting net zero targets.
impacts made clear considered explicitly policy- making paper.
need thinking impacts today' economic policies prospects future generations.
costs failing take approach considers climate impacts eye watering.
2022 report grantham institute found climate change damages projected triple 2050 double 50 years later, climate prudence fiscal prudence one thing.
given obr' main duty assess health economy sustainability public finances, needs charged assessing whether fiscal events reducing increasing climate risks economy.
bringing net zero obr' mandate consistent government' five missions.
indeed, announcing clean energy superpower document, labour said add net zero mandates relevant regulators need.
would argue obr relevant regulator needs net zero mandate.
proposing probing amendment today.
members mentioned, would also represent increased transparency around fiscal policy choices impacting' progress towards net zero targets help ensure future governments also consider.
also important stepping stone towards net zero test, would assess aggregate climate nature impact every fiscal event., something labour committed opposition.
winding-

hope labour use opportunity commit publicly introducing net zero test government, take step towards backing amendment.
