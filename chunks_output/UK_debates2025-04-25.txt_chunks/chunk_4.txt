scottish tourism alliance also says: “introducing scottish specific visa scheme would match immigration demand certain skills”— done centuries— “but also encourage people coming live work scotland, particularly rural island communities experiencing drain people working age families.
thank.
member giving way bringing forward debate, interesting nothing else.
snp suggest encourage people live scotland, particularly rural scotland, given anyone scotland earning £28, 500 pays income tax; local government £760 billion- odd shortfall, affects rural communities, given money spent larger area; scotland housing crisis?
things attract people?

scottish government policy?
well, talked labour colleagues —although, would expect, conservative party, ideological reasons—about progressive taxation system earn less pay less, earn pay.
criticise.
member gordon buchan( harriet cross), stood election conservative manifesto, always surprised labour party take opportunity endorse system strongly.
70% scottish government' budget still comes form block grant westminster—that huge amount.
talk heard decentralisation, empowerment, sensible approach?.
gentleman rightly mentions block grant., says—not entirely correctly—the block grant largest part scottish budget, vote budget block grant gave scottish government £4.
billion extra? find striking scottish government receive block grant, rather making decisions, snp benches would like, spent years tory austerity staring barrel cuts elsewhere.
secretary state might quote figures terms cash, years years tory government helped labour party, cuts come result brexit, endorse, cut winter fuel allowance labour brought, scottish government brought measures offset— bedroom tax.

scottish care said: “the current immigration system failing social care sector scotland.
recent rule changes, particularly ban dependents”— big impact sectors well— “and incompatible increase minimum salary threshold, exacerbate existing recruitment challenges pose significant risks sustainability delivery essential care services.

know ban dependants also significant impact higher education sector.
glad see convenor- party parliamentary university group,.
member erewash( adam thompson), place.
higher education institutions constituencies—i refer entry register members' financial interests—will know damage done ban bringing dependants country.
care issue matters deeply, problem care getting cheap labour elsewhere; paying care workers enough.
one things national care service would seek solve.
snp waste much money—£28 million—on failed national care service, rather working across house good faith deliver care people need?
order.
