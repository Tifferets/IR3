friend right well building energy system deliver generation capacity future, need work fast possible reduce demand.
part moving away gas heat pumps.
important energy system climate, individual households reducing bills.
already see huge shift uptake heat pumps across country., course, much reach target, government committed, important households right across country.
echo points insulation.
fuel poverty likely live houses cold.
create warmer homes—that- secretary state energy security net zero,.
friend member peckham( miatta fahnbulleh), doing—the better everyone.
last week coldest week winter.
also last week, 41.% energy mix gas 25% wind.
heard issues gas storage, government penalising oil gas sector extending windfall tax, allowing new licences, removing investment allowances.
feels like government taking energy security seriously.
minister reassure house case, engage oil gas companies ensure secure energy today, despite trying future?
give assurance.
indeed, every month job, aberdeen, meeting oil gas companies discuss issues.
going agree everything, clear long future oil gas north sea.
yes, absolutely said want issue new licences new fields, revoke existing licences.
means continue work north sea long time come.
repeat categorically untrue electricity gas supplies risk past week.
robust systems place, worked exactly.
consumers lost absolutely supply last days, weeks months ahead.
draw attention house entry register members' financial interests membership energy unions, gmb unite.
2017, energy minister, noble lord harrington, said: “the closure rough cause problem security. ”
—[ official report, 27 june 2017; vol.

minister confirm five wasted years followed rough reopened reduced capacity continue impose restraints network?
government take open- minded approach centrica' proposals gradually convert storage capacity hydrogen?
commercial decisions centrica, although brings decisions, course look.
let reiterate robust set storage facilities ensure security supply.
rough one, moments, winter, important, slowest move gas system.
remainder entirely robust state continue deliver, said, chooses site commercial matter centrica.
heard house today- reliance gas, surely, reality,- reliance imported gas.
forces government seem driving hands foreign suppliers, much 80% gas may imported 2030.
support domestic sources oil gas, back 200, 000 industry jobs found constituencies across land, rather pushing people cliff?
take issue two points.
first, past decade, 100, 000 jobs already lost oil gas industry, happened government.
gentleman supported.
industry changing.
putting place robust set plans help workforce jobs future, rather burying heads sand pretending basin north sea super- mature.
secondly, even extract gas continental shelf, given traded international market, pricing set international market, would continue pay, whether came north sea, would deal pricing issue reflected.
gentleman' question.
minister assume government robbed pensioners winter fuel allowance, gas consumption would go, government obsessed net zero policy really care whether enough gas meet energy needs?
minister realise reliant foreign suppliers push fuel prices?
justify fact net zero policy, government ignoring fact 150 years- worth gas naturally stored, use?
let repeat said moment ago: even take much gas continental shelf, would still traded international market.
reason right.
gentleman' constituents mine still face cost living crisis exposure petrostates dictators around world.
would clearly like expose even, think conservatives would support, want get rollercoaster volatile fossil fuels deliver clean power system cheaper long run delivers energy security.
best consumers, constituents.
minister several times mentioned energy security, said drive net zero make energy- secure, europe learned lesson taking fossil fuels russia, take renewable resources china, manufactures processes vast majority materials needed.
contingency plans minister made case china decides get trade war renewables, cut supply?
threats could come china exactly came russia fossil fuels.
let say two things right.
gentleman.
first, approach china co- operate interest, challenge necessary.
point chancellor making.
secondly, way ensure describes happen, build much possible country, build industrial base country bring clean power jobs.
last government failed.
driving forward industrial strategy ensure jobs arise clean power plan designed country.
opposition either support oppose.
whole discussion underlines importance electricity storage, including battery energy storage system constituency, bredbury substation.
encourage communities welcome besss area, perhaps considering community benefits, district heat networks?.
lady makes really important point energy storage various forms.
