previous government answer decisions made.
making clear way build energy system need long term clean power action plan.
conservatives used support much, increasingly, decided walk away.
either keep attached volatile fossil fuel markets, price spikes constituents continue pay price, come alternative plan.
getting work.
encourage minister come combat mode second consider constructive proposal?
become- dependent gas wind blow sun shine, want dependent foreign countries indefinitely, see future role modular nuclear reactors?
kind attack mode, opposition seem dealing reality, think important correct.
right.
gentleman right future energy mix, outlined clean power action plan, involve range technologies.
outlined range would expect, nuclear—in particular small modular reactors—will play incredibly important part.
moving forward programme inherited previous government, yet another incomplete process.
make happen quickly possible, smrs play key role energy mix.
following previous question, clearly, previous government delay investing starting nuclear power opportunities options.
progress made since government came power plans take forward nuclear power part supply??
conservative members ask, “when?
—they 14 years power, 14 years build single new nuclear project.
former minister nuclear,.
member west aberdeenshire kincardine( andrew bowie), loves shout consultations launched, build single new nuclear power station..
friend right make point move forward nuclear—we want see nuclear projects move forward quickly possible.. friend minister nuclear moving forward two biggest projects, well small modular reactor competition.
quite rightly going process ensure robust possible, say due course.
last friday, met wales& west utilities, runs gas grid constituency beyond, heard hydrogen still viable option home heating.
although number pilots, government recently gone quite quiet hydrogen home heating.
minister update steps taking progress hydrogen home heating?.
lady raises potential hydrogen energy mix.
course, one real strengths gas network changed things future; real strength, looking options might.
mix options available hydrogen, including home heating, could still play really key role industrial projects, example, shorter term.
looking projects.
need ensure financially viable worked technological details would make happen.
say due course.
understanding notices issued times high demand, evidence system working order prevent power cuts system breaking.
would thought conservatives would learned lesson spike international gas prices caused crisis people' fuel bills led cost living crisis, learned nothing.. friend minister agree really underlines policy ensuring secure provision renewable energy, leaves less open spikes prices international market?.
friend absolutely right.
worth saying electricity margin notices unexpected, particularly time year.
mean enough generation available meet demand, neso would like see larger safety cushion; important point people understand margin notices.
notice cancelled, course, sufficient supply ensure cushion.. friend' broader point important.
outlined great detail deliver clean power 2030.
conservatives claim oppose; fact, oppose much net zero full stop.
answer would deliver secure resilient energy system future brings bills delivers climate leadership.
unconvinced, use parliamentary language, minister' reassurance lights almost go last week.
also unconvinced saying system robust resilient.
minister told electors scotland energy bills would come £300 government.
gone, go twice.
given perilous gas storage situation—it%, compared 25% eu enjoys—what steps take de- stress system accelerating investment long- duration energy storage?
thank.
gentleman characteristic question.
first point, let say said anything margins.
quoted national energy system operator, actually delivers country—and quote benefit.
gentleman: “at point electricity supplies less anticipated demand engineers able rebalance system”.
take leave words—i particularly bothered—but words people actually operate energy system.. gentleman' final point, absolutely agree importance long- duration energy storage., first time 40 years, government announced new cap-- floor regime deliver new long- duration energy storage schemes.
huge step forward position many previous governments, allow building pumped hydro schemes new innovative technologies deliver energy storage.
moving fast possible.
hope.
friends support decisions.
thank minister updating reassuring house residents robustness system, work taking forward wider diversification energy supply.
update house support take- heat pumps, ensure, long run, far less dependent gas overseas?
also say something importance insulation government support measures encourage insulation?.
friend right well building energy system deliver generation capacity future, need work fast possible reduce demand.
part moving away gas heat pumps.
important energy system climate, individual households reducing bills.
