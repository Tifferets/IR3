friend right degrading—attrited, say military terms—that capability.
however, still case houthis capable launching attacks.
extent?
well, house come conclusions, note gap first three rounds attacks relatively short, gap fourth round longer.
, wait see response.
interdictions: yes, certainly continue try ensure iran resupplying.
single best message go house iran stop activity.
worth noting interdictions past years—and, course, continue.
call snp spokesperson.
first, let thank secretary state due sight statement.
think, opposition party, would give tentative support.
shadow defence secretary said possible mission creep give concern, sure role opposition keep asking questions.
secretary state knows last question regarding issue position people' republic china.
recently, exports europe china excess £400 billion year, doubt suffer result extended time takes travel china europe, beggars belief china' utter silence relation going on—notably, given military naval capacity djibouti.
secretary state disagree issue gaza.
secured real vote last week, would probably seen recorded formally house.
gerald.
feierstein, former diplomat, said “the houthis' effort insert gaza conflict” aimed “strengthening support base country cementing movement firmly the… ‘axis resistance’”.
wonder whether, like, secretary state concerned strengthening axis resistance, illicit chinese russian support, broadening red sea.
thank.
member his—as described it—tentative support.
noted house largely unified issue past four statements, following previous attacks.
asks mission creep situation.
hope feels reassured concept waited longer, part houthis' capabilities damaged, longer gap see thing speeding.
intention desire see increase, act continue attacks commercial naval shipping.. member asks china russia say agree; important countries impacted this—the entire world, perhaps china particular—do speak.
would welcome china vocal situation.
mentioned comments, chinese vessel attacked, direct concern country.
call china, course, russia—for worth—to vocal issues.
lastly, accept gaza- houthi connection.
remind house houthis hamas 2015, arrive scene pretend support.
opportunist thugs taking advantage situation people' lives misery—not gaza yemen—and stop desist immediately.
secretary state recall, handling topic february, strongly endorsed suggestion lot trouble middle east linked tactics divert war ukraine.
given route happening ukraine happening middle east via russia iran, satisfied inconsistency tough line taken ministry defence houthis soft line taken foreign office iranian sponsors?
somewhat reject characterisation.
absolutely clear, much view iran responsible; funds, trains provides equipment houthis many iranian- sponsored proxies region.
also case probably lost control.
important deliver messages many different ways iranians.
seen read- outs ways delivered, including directly, foreign secretary—and anything weak.
put secretary state similar question one put prime minister 23 january: course want diplomatic solution—any ramping military solution consequences—but many months secretary state government going allow continue?

saying.
gentleman, keen see two issues inextricably linked.
accept.
gentleman trying.
working hard wider solution.
welcome statement defence secretary' leadership.
clear houthi threat may last months, right plays role protecting international shipping, typhoons tasked cyprus surface fleet cannot hit targets range land.
know defence secretary looking new vertical launch system rectify, agree urgent operational requirement introduce guided multiple launch rocket systems new precision- strike missile would allow royal navy, already tasked red sea, help eliminate houthi threat?
always good reasons introduce new capabilities.
fact, recently hms somerset devonport, system fitted trialled.
case, sometimes characterised, using typhoons another option; first preference work way range reasons cannot enter dispatch box.
worth noting carried actions iraq syria, planes flew way, aware anybody saying facilities closer hand.
using correct facilities particular operation, notwithstanding fact always nice new facilities.
agree secretary state must always think servicemen women carry tasks.
former defence minister, news defence secretary agree strikes, perhaps defence secretary power predecessors.
policy strategy behind set circumstances?
number defence committee members met defence minister italy weeks ago rome.
italy deploying region.- led operation?
build alliances italy european nations interest?.
