make one quite reasonable request secretary state: consider applications round rather individually, look cumulative effect food production local environment?
even ambitious scenarios, less% agricultural land would occupied solar farms.
right.
gentleman' point holistically planned, strategic spatial energy planning taken forward important coherent view entire energy system.
work done many, many years ago.
moving pace, individual planning applications are— call luke murphy.
conservative party opposes large- scale solar, net zero onshore wind, tempted ask minister makes party' new energy policy, take back past, rub two sticks together hope best.
instead, update house progress great british energy delivering clean energy mission?
think rehearsed arguments absolute failure previous government past 14 years.
conservatives gone back today.
