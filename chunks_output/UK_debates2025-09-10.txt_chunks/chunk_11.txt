would wish drawn discuss important incident allies.
take issue.
gentleman' characterisation.
conflict gaza question relates primarily arms.
tiny supplier residual arms.
suspended sale arms could used gaza.
much fuller arms relationships—[ interruption.]
figure 15%.. gentleman says “15%, fact means 15% components total- 35 supply.
truth total supply israel less%.
minister absolutely right call session nations—nobody think attacking people trying broker peace going lead ceasefire—but ahead, country must made assessment case session motion.
minister tell assessment officials made civilian casualties whether strike proportionate boundaries laws armed conflict, set international law?
go un, case making? would want drawn casualty tally.
set response, qatar clear assessments things tend develop immediate aftermath strike, drawn casualties number people struck.
qatar, quite rightly, release information available.. friend asks international law tests strike must judged.
tests self- defence imminence, session un security council tests would expect israel able satisfy.
issue, many issues qatar, saudi arabia middle east nations developed real niche leadership mediation conflict resolution.
minister look conflict resolution unit resources spend, double working qataris mediation efforts?
right.
gentleman raises important question.
strength relationship qatar conflict mediation capabilities important area work.
understand deeply important negotiator foreign office, national security adviser.
due discussion qatari ministerial counterpart.
regrettably, continually delayed events region, hope soon.
qatar ally, key negotiator mediator gaza ceasefire talks.
committing atrocities gaza, illegal settlements west bank, marching syria, attacking lebanon, iran, yemen qatar, israeli government proven rogue ally dangerous neighbour.
point draw line sand call israeli government are—a danger peace middle east?
thank.
friend long commitment issues.
heard condemnation, well previous foreign secretary, current foreign secretary prime minister, many israeli government' actions relation gaza, west bank elsewhere.
disagree israeli government, clear forceful saying.
given israel continues act impunity, new levers government use take actions within powers, restrictions travel trade, air sea delivery aid—given land delivery appalling—and relation- 35?
breaching international humanitarian laws; please stop?
like get ahead courts question- 35.
extensive legal argumentation al- haq case, find way.
gentleman suggests.
turning question air sea access gaza, methods tried.
supported airdrops alongside jordanian partners summer, desperation get aid strip.
however, cannot escape fact airdrops pinprick best, given overall scale need.
aid operation works track record, nations operation.
sea? sea also tried, particularly late period president biden, found effective mechanism getting aid.
get aid in—even small amounts—we, cannot pretend dispatch box methods land routes un support reach scale required meet need.
pleased see minister back dispatch box, although sure whether equally pleased come back chamber answer questions illegal actions israeli government.
situation one allies unlawfully attacked another allies.
given rightly standing qataris, time recognised actions doha continuous starvation murder innocent civilians gaza, right- wing israeli government extreme right- wing israeli prime minister longer allies?
thank.
friend kind words reappointment.
recognise force said israeli politics; appropriate one foreign minister comment internal politics another country, sanctions announced dispatch box june, house see strength government' feeling about—for example—the rhetoric smotrich ben- gvir.
deeply disheartening see rhetoric repeated course summer,, demonstrate strongest possible way strength feeling questions.
events took place earlier week jerusalem, yesterday, prove two extremes conflict interest peace.
hamas benefits violence, right wing israeli government also profits seeks expand israel' territory subject palestinian people.
entirely agree right.
friend member north west hampshire( kit malthouse) amplify points made.
following yesterday' events, trump american administration appear annoyed israel rest world, time call israel' bluff nations?
time seek engagement blue helmets similar force, enable say, “we, international community, people ground.
don’t dare fire area.
let trigger peace talks.
without catalyst, two extremes continue, along performative merry- go- round “here go again”, condemnation, another statement urgent question.
fear three four years' time, rubble gaza, israeli government even rogue government, forward.
right.
gentleman absolutely right risks gaza—we seen rubble grow.
british government would support international forces going gaza agreement parties.
response right.
member north west hampshire( kit malthouse), spoke experience limitations peacekeeping forces peace enforce.
depressingly clear- eyed continuing intent sides continue conducting violence, exactly right.
gentleman described.
