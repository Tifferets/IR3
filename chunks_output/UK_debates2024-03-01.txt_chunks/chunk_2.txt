yesterday, major counselling, therapeutic health organisations provisionally agreed indicative vote support bill, organisation voting.
british medical association royal college nursing support ban conversion practices.
let come evidence asked.
government survey 2017, recently commissioned piece work 2023, indicating live issue.
according research, one five people subject someone trying change, cure suppress sexual orientation transgender identity.
one five people religious faith background, one six non- religious background, experienced conversion therapy.. member devizes( danny kruger) attended one drop- briefings bill, asked number young people affected practices.
weighted yougov survey—using usual weighting metrics—of, 000 people 2023, 10% aged 65 said undergone offered conversion therapy, whereas figure% 16 17- year-
olds,% 18 34- year- olds—shockingly high.
shows live issue.
nspcc, heard: 50 young people phoned helpline last year, saying threatened, subjected, conversion practices.
know members would prefer bring ban sexual orientation conversion practices—lgb only—and touch transgender elements.
couple reasons think would foolish approach.
first, government carried reviews repeatedly said need trans- inclusive ban.
fact, ministers said trans conversion main concern.
cannot say huge concern people might converted transgender, say need ban either- way conversion therapy.
secondly, must recognise lgb transgender separate, interlinked.
people exploring sexual orientation sometimes come consider transgender status.
include transgender would allow loophole whereby people wanted force someone gay, trans, could claim offering transgender therapy, rather lgb therapy, would make bill useless.
thirdly, pretty well- established research lgb conversion therapy problem, significant growing research, around world, conversion therapy problem transgender community well.
fact, minister women equalities, right.
