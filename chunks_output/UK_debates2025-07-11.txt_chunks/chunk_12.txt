friend member christchurch( christopher chope).
approaches private members' bills way jeweller examines diamonds—with magnifying glass, steady hand absolutely tolerance flaws.
may grumble clock ticks, deep sleep better knowing reading footnotes.
bill different; approached rigour, thank commitment precision improving clarity accountability.
pointed, bill trivial.
therefore, right, indeed duty house, scrutinise closely legislation amendments laid.
end, several amendments aim tighten bill' drafting introduce firmer deadlines.
example, amendment would reduce timeframe review clause three years two.
amendment would require secretary state “set timetable implementing changes law recommended review.
understand concern reviews drift, three- year period reflects complexity subject:- wide review human medicines regulations 2012, including benchmarking jurisdictions engaging multiple agencies.
compressing timeline might jeopardise depth quality analysis.
likewise, statutory timetable implementation could constrain government prematurely, review' conclusions even known.
grateful. friend unprompted comments.
