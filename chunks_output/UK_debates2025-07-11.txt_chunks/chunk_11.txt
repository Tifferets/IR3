rather, abolished.
perhaps both—demolished abolished!, seeking include, primary legislation, reference, government' view, already redundant body? would expected government come forward amendment, service, always, accept amendment, leave “in opinion nhs england” remove nhs england, references organisation, bill.

amendment definition rare cancer, aspect bill spoken great detail, worth touching.

friend member christchurch( christopher chope)., though, congratulate.
member edinburgh south west( dr arthur) bill.
generally supportive think entirely necessary.
turning amendments,.
friend member christchurch right.
concern words “the opinion secretary state” included proposed new subsection() section 1e national health service act 2006..
friend pointed, proposed new subsection() section 1e proposed new subsection( 5a) section 261 health social care act 2012 set definition rare cancer, bill passes, definition become law.
therefore think contradiction within piece legislation: contains absolute definition rare cancer, adds ambiguity referring “opinion” secretary state.
ask minister explain things true.
secretary state decides definition rare cancer, possibly line definition written law?.
member edinburgh south west said, definition included bill—that rare cancer “a cancer affects 2000 people kingdom”— aligns rare diseases framework, published lord bethell place 2021.
seems effective suitable definition,, ask minister whether expects definition.
expect, necessary include words “the opinion secretary state”?
bill even consistent.
