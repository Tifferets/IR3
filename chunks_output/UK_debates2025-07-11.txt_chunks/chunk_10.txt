case, generous amendment, would restrict period three years two years, unacceptable government?
history dragging feet department health social care, afraid; certainly heard second reading.
give house specific example, government' evidence, accept change three years two.
amendment would leave “in particular” line, reads: “in carrying review secretary state must, particular, consider regulatory approaches countries.
amendment intended probe rather anything else.
words “in particular” need incorporated?
surely would simpler say secretary state “must consider regulatory approaches countries”—full stop, period.
moment.
amendment would leave reference secretary state.
definition rare cancer.
currently, clause would add wording national health service act 2006: “the research secretary must facilitate otherwise promote subsection()() includes research cancers opinion secretary state rare cancers.
cannot say “that rare cancers”?
indeed, clause would also add wording 2006 act: “in section ‘rare cancer’ means cancer affects 2000 people.
issue fact.
secretary state able basically veto interpretation rare cancer.
another example control freakery within department.
sorry far minister seem stood officials persuaded, doubt, need expression “in opinion secretary state”., argument quite straightforward people pancreatic cancer side, obviously keen bill get statute book.
recognise within government' power prevent making progress.
quite difficult, suppose, persuade minister accept amendment.
amendment would leave “are” end line insert “arrangements place to” statement clause: “in discharging duty subsection()() relation cancers, secretary state must, particular, ensure arrangements place secretary state considers appropriate to”. say “arrangements place enable potential participants clinical trials”,?
need give secretary state discretion —a veto, essentially—over whether considers arrangements appropriate?
seems completely redundant, unnecessary, indeed, oppressive.
counter expressed wishes house second reading, impatience delay, need get, suspicion failure department health social care—under government previous governments, would first accept—to actually deal crisis involving people subject rare cancers.
amendment.
trying beetle amendments quite quickly, madam, people participate important debate.
amendment attempts tie clinical trials able implemented.
relates research, requirement secretary state ensure appointment person known national speciality lead rare cancers, timescale done, proposing six months.
wider issue, though.
reason appointment could made.
reason could made bill first introduced.
quite clear impact assessment speciality lead appointed quango, essentially, already specialty leads whole lot issues.
appoint person?
said cost appointment mere £16, 000. understand necessary include bill specific requirement appointment made know national institute health care research national speciality leads research delivery within research delivery network.
role “primarily support research delivery discipline within health care settings, knowledge experience full scope nihr wider health care delivery infrastructure england.
leads work patients, public, health care professionals including research development communities within nhs wider care systems, academics life sciences partners.
“aim ensure strategic oversight focus continuous improvement research delivery portfolio.
specialty leads therefore already exist.
exist courtesy specific legislation requiring exist; already exist nihr.
nihr appointed specialty lead deal rare cancers?
necessary legislate require, weak legislation set timetable making appointment?, view, another reason tightening bill.
impact assessment, policy objectives,: “this aims ensure adequate oversight research delivery rare cancers, appointing named person england provide leadership advice delivery rare cancer research.
envisaged individual would employed nihr.
accepted person would employed nihr, wait person employed?
said cost £16, 000 year.
amendments, trying emphasise need proportionality.
amendment would leave “in opinion nhs england” clause.
know, nhs england short opinions, bye. clause(): “after subsection() insert—( 5a) subsection()( da) ‘relevant clinical trials' means clinical trials connection research development orphan medicinal products diagnosis, prevention treatment cancers opinion nhs england rare cancers”., already referred.
bill defines rare cancers “a cancer affects, 000 people., nhs england?
definition rare cancer already bill.
surely, matter fact?
subject qualification second- guessing nhs england, bill?
submission, gives department wriggle room.
perhaps means whole lot people nhs england work whether particular cancer complies definition rare cancer “affects, 000 people”.
another problem.
bill refers opinion nhs england.
understood, nhs england is—to great delight—about demolished.
rather, abolished.
perhaps both—demolished abolished!, seeking include, primary legislation, reference, government' view, already redundant body? would expected government come forward amendment, service, always, accept amendment, leave “in opinion nhs england” remove nhs england, references organisation, bill.
hope tempting minister accept amendments tempting members speak support.
