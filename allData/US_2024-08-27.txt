declaration regularly repeated reaffirmed leaders five nuclear weapon 2022. recognition start end every conversation nuclear weapons. nevertheless, nuclear powers, since advent cold war, instead seem concluded deterrence requires nuclear weapons every kind adversary. today, logic, find engaged three- way nuclear arms race russia, china,, blaming starting continuing. nation, fearing adversary may outflank, continues build nuclear infrastructure: nuclear silos chinas western deserts, nuclear weapons satellites, replacement icbms. nation seeks strengthen hand, goes... constant buildup country asks,`` build faster?`` target ignores important question:? leadership requires rigorous use three- letter word,``. must avoid blind adherence yesterdays decisions. todays discussion, means asking sufficient nuclear deterrence. looking past strategies relying past assumptions isnt enough. old cold- war mentalities create unacceptable costs, rob alternatives, place even greater danger. instead, must think boldly repeat problems history. mind, bring question``. know full well face hostile world numerous aggressive adversaries. also know engaged nuclear arms race china russia. nations also known nuclear weapons, others seek. dangerous environment, deterrence must consider far great- power nuclear exchange. also seen threat use nuclear weapons deter non- nuclear aggression. putin used irresponsible nuclear threats try prevent support ukrainian people defense country. course, one yet used weapons, fact know grateful, every threat comes risk use. matter, prevalence nuclear weapons places world risk. today, must think terms threat also terms future., let ask foundational question: need nuclear weapons?, many kind? proponents often justify nuclear weapons two reasons:() deter fight strategic nuclear exchange major powers,() deter non- nuclear aggression. focusing first category, deterring opponent using strategic tactical nuclear weapons, history would indicate strategy worked 70 years... record understates close came causing destruction. several near- disastrous incidents motivated leaders back away undertake several treaties reduce weapons risks. leaders like reagan, jfk, eisenhower, carter, obama knew nuclear weapons could end civilization, heavy moral ethical considerations mind, negotiated significant safety measures serious reduction nuclear weapons. leaders demonstrated vision commitment. knew war option, create vision safer future. unfortunately, many today shrug shoulders say time negations. brings yet another question: try? next 30 years, spend almost trillion dollars nuclear weapons. spent% diplomatic risk reduction efforts? second category limiting non- nuclear aggression carries risks. proponents using nuclear weapons suggest could use`` tactical weapons limited way. however, nuclear option starts, tactical exchange proceed? chaos fog war, would tactical nuclear option open way full- scale devastation? many`` think tanks studied, day, result`` open pandoras box. despite limitations, categories also continue justify spending massive nuclear arsenal. even use justify larger larger expenses. brings another question: chosen spend defense dollars modernizing every element current nuclear systems? question become increasingly important timelines slip costs grow nuclear modernization programs. example, fresh first nunn- mccurdy review, sentinel program cost least$ 140 billion, including new bomb another$ 30 billion unknown costs plutonium pit production. obligation ask.` extraordinary cost increases, far importantly, sentinel program? alternative would deter adversaries effectively? history important guide matter. 1950s 1960s, nuclear enterprise developed ground- based icbms, continued years. today, members, without scrutiny, repeat mantra 400 ground- based icbms necessary. 40 years advent ssbns 20 years stealth bombers, ground- based icbms necessary? missiles sit silos, far, heart, whose locations known cow hands, sheepherders, targeting personnel bunkers adversaries., nuclear crisis, adversaries chose target missile fields, launch early destroy missiles whose locations known. thus, mmiii sentinel create extraordinarily dangerous situation. event perceived attack, would immense pressure president make decision launch within minutes risk losing missiles. mind, spend massive amount money system vulnerable extraordinarily dangerous? defense policy, nothing sacred untouchable, everything require frequent- evaluation., let afraid ask yet another question: triad? strategy cannot afford stagnant. cannot afford complacently accept assumptions past. must ask need ground leg triad. nuclear program deterrence, firepower submarines, airplanes, missiles sufficient dissuade adversary? systems benefit stealth, president time gather information decide whether use nuclear response. enough, also conventional weapons deter adversaries. even retain leg, must reevaluate whats truly necessary within. infinite resources must make difficult choices allocate national resources. rethink whether achieve deterrence different mixes, lets prioritize safety effectiveness fulfilling antiquated assumptions requirements. remember, matter matching capability capability. ensure future survival. often, debates deterrence consider rapidly changing security environment; cyber warfare, uncertainty, confusion, misunderstanding could greater risks aggression. heavily dependent space observation communication systems, know space war real routinely discussed. weigh risks decide continue keep 400 sentinel mmiii missiles, prepared kill millions, constant alert, ready immediate launch moments certainly chaos uncertainty? surely, destructive capability always better. need many? considering many weapons deter conflict military problem tit-- tat calculations. national victory could, important adversaries, ever hope achieve end nuclear war inevitably kills hundreds millions people, including tens millions americans, destroys entire cities, endangers environment planet? think deterrence modern era, clear rising costs existential dangers cannot afford new arms race. course, must grapple hard questions deter dangerous adversaries. still, must answer even harder question: deter way ensures tomorrow worth protecting? must continue 50- year- old triad strategy without considering alternatives?, stuck logic silo blast door closed? want end discussion captain nuclear- armed submarine. touring ship, stopped foot ladder thank discussion. said`` appreciate enormous responsibility difficult task. receive message launch missiles,, next? go home? ill never forget look face. dont know ever contemplated question, thats question must ask today.
