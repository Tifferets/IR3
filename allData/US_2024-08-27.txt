continue inspire knew today rise address future nuclear posture ronald reagan gorbachev two cold warriors head worlds largest nuclear arsenals declared nuclear war cannot must never fought declaration regularly repeated reaffirmed leaders five nuclear weapon recognition start end every conversation nuclear weapons nevertheless nuclear powers since advent cold war instead seem concluded deterrence requires nuclear weapons every kind adversary today logic find engaged three way nuclear arms race russia china blaming starting continuing nation fearing adversary may outflank continues build nuclear infrastructure nuclear silos chinas western deserts nuclear weapons satellites replacement icbms nation seeks strengthen hand goes constant buildup country asks build faster target ignores important question leadership requires rigorous use three letter word must avoid blind adherence yesterdays decisions todays discussion means asking sufficient nuclear deterrence looking past strategies relying past assumptions isnt enough old cold war mentalities create unacceptable costs rob alternatives place even greater danger instead must think boldly repeat problems history mind bring question know full well face hostile world numerous aggressive adversaries also know engaged nuclear arms race china russia nations also known nuclear weapons others seek dangerous environment deterrence must consider far great power nuclear exchange also seen threat use nuclear weapons deter non nuclear aggression putin used irresponsible nuclear threats try prevent support ukrainian people defense country course one yet used weapons fact know grateful every threat comes risk use matter prevalence nuclear weapons places world risk today must think terms threat also terms future let ask foundational question need nuclear weapons many kind proponents often justify nuclear weapons two reasons deter fight strategic nuclear exchange major powers deter non nuclear aggression focusing first category deterring opponent using strategic tactical nuclear weapons history would indicate strategy worked years record understates close came causing destruction several near disastrous incidents motivated leaders back away undertake several treaties reduce weapons risks leaders like reagan jfk eisenhower carter obama knew nuclear weapons could end civilization heavy moral ethical considerations mind negotiated significant safety measures serious reduction nuclear weapons leaders demonstrated vision commitment knew war option create vision safer future unfortunately many today shrug shoulders say time negations brings yet another question try next years spend almost trillion dollars nuclear weapons spent diplomatic risk reduction efforts second category limiting non nuclear aggression carries risks proponents using nuclear weapons suggest could use tactical weapons limited way however nuclear option starts tactical exchange proceed chaos fog war would tactical nuclear option open way full scale devastation many think tanks studied day result open pandoras box despite limitations categories also continue justify spending massive nuclear arsenal even use justify larger larger expenses brings another question chosen spend defense dollars modernizing every element current nuclear systems question become increasingly important timelines slip costs grow nuclear modernization programs example fresh first nunn mccurdy review sentinel program cost least billion including new bomb another billion unknown costs plutonium pit production obligation ask extraordinary cost increases far importantly sentinel program alternative would deter adversaries effectively history important guide matter nuclear enterprise developed ground based icbms continued years today members without scrutiny repeat mantra ground based icbms necessary years advent ssbns years stealth bombers ground based icbms necessary missiles sit silos far heart whose locations known cow hands sheepherders targeting personnel bunkers adversaries nuclear crisis adversaries chose target missile fields launch early destroy missiles whose locations known thus mmiii sentinel create extraordinarily dangerous situation event perceived attack would immense pressure president make decision launch within minutes risk losing missiles mind spend massive amount money system vulnerable extraordinarily dangerous defense policy nothing sacred untouchable everything require frequent evaluation let afraid ask yet another question triad strategy cannot afford stagnant cannot afford complacently accept assumptions past must ask need ground leg triad nuclear program deterrence firepower submarines airplanes missiles sufficient dissuade adversary systems benefit stealth president time gather information decide whether use nuclear response enough also conventional weapons deter adversaries even retain leg must reevaluate whats truly necessary within infinite resources must make difficult choices allocate national resources rethink whether achieve deterrence different mixes lets prioritize safety effectiveness fulfilling antiquated assumptions requirements remember matter matching capability capability ensure future survival often debates deterrence consider rapidly changing security environment cyber warfare uncertainty confusion misunderstanding could greater risks aggression heavily dependent space observation communication systems know space war real routinely discussed weigh risks decide continue keep sentinel mmiii missiles prepared kill millions constant alert ready immediate launch moments certainly chaos uncertainty surely destructive capability always better need many considering many weapons deter conflict military problem tit tat calculations national victory could important adversaries ever hope achieve end nuclear war inevitably kills hundreds millions people including tens millions americans destroys entire cities endangers environment planet think deterrence modern era clear rising costs existential dangers cannot afford new arms race course must grapple hard questions deter dangerous adversaries still must answer even harder question deter way ensures tomorrow worth protecting must continue year old triad strategy without considering alternatives stuck logic silo blast door closed want end discussion captain nuclear armed submarine touring ship stopped foot ladder thank discussion said appreciate enormous responsibility difficult task receive message launch missiles next go home ill never forget look face dont know ever contemplated question thats question must ask today
