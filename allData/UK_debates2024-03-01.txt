evidence asked government survey recently commissioned piece work indicating live issue according research one five people subject someone trying change cure suppress sexual orientation transgender identity one five people religious faith background one six non religious background experienced conversion therapy member devizes danny kruger attended one drop briefings bill asked number young people affected practices weighted yougov survey using usual weighting metrics people aged said undergone offered conversion therapy whereas figure year olds year olds shockingly high shows live issue nspcc heard young people phoned helpline last year saying threatened subjected conversion practices know members would prefer bring ban sexual orientation conversion practices lgb touch transgender elements couple reasons think would foolish approach first government carried reviews repeatedly said need trans inclusive ban fact ministers said trans conversion main concern cannot say huge concern people might converted transgender say need ban either way conversion therapy secondly must recognise lgb transgender separate interlinked people exploring sexual orientation sometimes come consider transgender status include transgender would allow loophole whereby people wanted force someone gay trans could claim offering transgender therapy rather lgb therapy would make bill useless thirdly pretty well established research lgb conversion therapy problem significant growing research around world conversion therapy problem transgender community well fact minister women equalities right member saffron walden kemi badenoch said letter february significant evidence children might subjected conversion practices transgender seen evidence endorse per se seen significant accounts many survivors forced transgender sides saying happening direction conversion irrelevant indication need take action bill friend mentioned nspcc report challenges young people facing sexuality gender identity findings include children young people last year wanted talk counsellors worries sexuality gender identity children described instances emotional abuse family home including constant shouting hurtful comments threats violence children threatened undergone form conversion practice intended cure sexuality gender identity friend agree passing bill help prevent children subjected send clear message allow people suffer painful abuse called conversion practices quite agree bill stops parents sending children conversion practices promise solve world lgbt people cannot promise parents shout abusive people say nasty things afraid nature democratic society sometimes stop premeditated purposes processes courses conduct activities aim something cannot done every bill world topic done bill goes directions whatever direction conversion abhorrent must stopped said existing legislation covers violent physical acts course violent abusive bullying coercion harassment caught current crimes government consultation said new criminal law needed fill gap physical abuse process causes long term harm bill therefore makes clear statement conversion practices illegal egregious cases prosecuted avoids clashing existing laws focused harm would result survivors retraumatised lengthy court battles instead looks intent behind actions get balance right bill clarifies certain actions constitute offence gentleman talking abusive practices practices cause harm course condemn anything abusive says vast majority acts already covered law bill actually mention abuse indeed harm threshold harm beyond practice could speech based activity unlawful example detransitioner mentioned keira bell trying persuade individual go ahead surgery hormone treatment would permanent impact could caught bill

question people via process bill says change someone sexual orientation change person transgender includes suppress sexual orientation transgender identity know nervous wording must clear suppression must level negating identity orientation means orientation must changed way many gay people never sex many transgender people wear gendered clothes actions constitute suppression negate orientation identity full part cannot claimed wording therefore overreach bill would use pre existing terms laws describe sexual orientation transgender transgender identity received interesting representation past days use term transgender rather interchangeable terms transgender transgender identity transgender clearly defined law moment better wording sort thing would willingly accept committee discussion real reason get committee work details sexual orientation course defined equality act terms person sexual feelings towards persons sex persons opposite sex persons either sex definition used section sentencing act transgender defined subsection follows references transgender include references transsexual undergoing proposing undergo undergone process part process gender reassignment
