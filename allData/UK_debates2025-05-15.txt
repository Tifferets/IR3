laid written ministerial statement yesterday, background changes around fixed- term recall light prison capacity challenges government face. elected almost year ago, inherited prison system brink collapse. although took immediate action prevent catastrophe, prisons continue perilously close filling entirely. last december published long- term building strategy, setting aim open 14, 000 prison places 2031. largest expansion prison estate since victorians. already committed £2. billion prison expansion, since taking office delivered, 400 new places. also commissioned independent sentencing review, report shortly. sentencing review hopefully offer path ending capacity crisis prisons good, impact sentencing reforms felt next spring. current trajectory, hit zero capacity prisons november—we cannot allow happen. announced intention lay fixed- term recall statutory instrument mean serving sentences one four years returned prison fixed 28- day period. measure builds previous legislation, introduced last government, mandated 14- day recalls serving sentences year. clear, higher- risk offenders exempted change. information relating offender' risk received recalled means longer considered suitable fixed- term recall, may detained longer standard recall assessed necessary. call shadow secretary state. “sorry” seems hardest word today. see justice secretary still come defend policy. yesterday deliberately avoided scrutiny house, knows decision wildly unpopular risks safety public. govern choose. 10, 500 foreign criminals jails 17, 000 people prison awaiting trial. combined, two groups make roughly third prison population. sensible step forward would obviously introduce emergency measures expedite deportations get courts sitting around clock. justice secretary chose, would support, far. refused take judiciary offer extra court sitting days. uncommon many half courts old bailey sit empty given day. instead, decided let early criminals reoffend breach licence. punishment deterrent criminals immediately reoffend cheat system. justice secretary says people “in prison outside prison”—i sure hardened criminals quaking boots farcical doublespeak. two ways: decision put public danger victims jeopardy. domestic abuse commissioner, nicole jacobs, said “cannot stress enough lack consideration victims' safety many lives put danger”. justice secretary minister really telling domestic abuse victims abusers back streets 28 days breach licence, nobody even check parole board? minister explain house exempted scheme, right confusion reigns? yesterday justice secretary gave impression domestic abusers sexual offenders would eligible scheme, department since said include “many”. written ministerial statement laid yesterday deliberately concealed answer question criminals excluded, minister take opportunity tell house? know answer, commit publishing end day? lastly, confirm house anyone breach restraining order ineligible fixed- term recall, anything else would insult victims? since taking office, deported, 800 foreign national offenders custody, securing early removal prisons—15% higher previous 12 months. announced 110, 000 court sitting days, highest level long time. answer right. gentleman' specific questions, exclude anyone serving four years prison; convicted terrorist national security crime; subject higher levels risk management multiple agencies police prison probation service work together, includes certain sexual violent offenders, including many domestic abusers. ongoing concerns risk posed offender due released 28- day period, frontline workers apply additional licence conditions manage. information related offender' risk received recalled, meaning longer considered suitable fixed- term recall, may detained longer standard recall, assessed necessary hmpps public protection team. know important victims kept informed. eligible victim contact scheme notified offender' release opportunity make representations victim- related licence conditions. although certain exclusions serious offenders, changing recalls fixed- term offenders necessary. would even worse run space, stage would mean managed breakdown criminal justice system. lord chancellor said rightly would unconscionable. government leave challenge legacy successors, right. gentleman' government. call chair justice committee. never forget crisis prisons current lord chancellor seeking resolve created 14 years irresponsible mismanagement previous government. although today' announcement makes sense short term, subject safeguards, must consider whole way recall developed, 100 cases 30 years ago 13, 000 today—over 15% prison population—with less 30% recalls offences. government consider way recall operates? without freeing space prisons, rehabilitation impossible, overcrowding reaches ridiculous levels run space altogether.. friend right: recall population doubled seven years need address. independent sentencing review report shortly, hope recommendations respond report. call liberal democrat spokesperson. doubt conservatives plunged prisons crisis.[ interruption.] chunter sedentary position, else would call? clear government failed step tackle sheer scale problem. across country, victims survivors worried mean. specific domestic abuse offence, dangerous offenders could excluded early release, government taken action since liberal democrats raised solution last autumn. minister finally commit giving victims survivors protections deserve creating new domestic abuse aggravated offences, go protect communities introducing clear plan reduce reoffending, way solve prison crowding? minister listen, listen domestic abuse commissioner, warned lives risk?. member know colleague,. member chichester( jess brown- fuller), working closely- secretary state justice,. friend member pontypridd( alex davies- jones), getting things right victims. something take seriously, needs done properly, victims, order get right. hope independent sentencing review report contain things give confidence moving forward way work victims. conservatives appear forgotten quite number things, think might good time remind. former justice secretary chris grayling' disastrous partial privatisation probation service overturned 2019 number serious offences—including rape murder—committed probation skyrocketed. minister agree seeing long tail conservative failure, overshadows everything must?. friend right remind house chaos turmoil conservatives applied important probation service government. putting probation back together. already brought, 000 new probation officers board, committed, 300 coming year., pick statement, think whole house grateful, sure committee take clear urging look issue regard ministerial code. know minister agree domestic abuse cannot issue lip service paid house policies seem neglect. make apologies returning views domestic abuse commissioner england wales, issued severe warning lord chancellor yesterday, commenting: “i cannot stress lack consideration victims' safety many lives put danger proposed change. minister think commissioner, expertise knowledge, arrived conclusion? great respect victims' commissioner. would letting victims allowed prison system get place cannot lock prisoners up—that would unconscionable. important taken steps. remind. member excluding prisoners pose risk managed mappa—multi- agency public protection arrangements—levels. means various agencies working together. exclusion also includes convicted terrorist national security crimes. proper action taken agencies identify risk move fixed- term recall standard recall. minister tell whether correct entered office, fewer 100 spaces left prisons—a terrible failure conservative party? agree instead empty words false promises build prisons, government getting job?. friend quite right. faced real emergency came office. unconscionable government would incoming government. previous labour government added 28, 000 prison places 13 years. 14 years, conservative government managed add 500. 10 months already delivered, 400 prison places. ministry justice conducted impact assessment policy?, release house soon possible?, lord chancellor confirm knows impact policy victims wider public? always alert need assess policies apply wider public victims. important. situation one egregious examples state failure consequence worst chaos incompetence last 14 years. lord chancellor clear, given current levels demand, cannot build way crisis. minister agree honest something different ensure never run prison places, including improving existing prison estate investing probation service, reduce reoffending thereby reduce pressure prison places? improving prison estate investing probation, also actions coming forward independent sentencing review. agree everything. friend said. victims domestic abuse, sexual abuse stalking fear, particularly live rural areas, tagging always work. particular measures minister put place support victims rural areas distant probation officers police? anybody subject fixed- term recall recalled 28 days, risk assessed greater, transferred standard recall. reality anybody affected already served time prison; licence, properly monitored effectively managed probation service. prison capacity crisis years making. minister welcome news wayland prison norfolk granted planning permission week, breckland council' planning committee, 25% increase capacity, 247 extra places? application alone represents 50% total places created last government 14 years. agree evidence government delivering years inaction?. friend exactly right point planning application going forward. excellent news, shows cracking job. although government volunteered defend position, accept, held ministerial responsibility prison estate, good options point. minister accept problem choosing return prison breach important licence conditions deterrent, reduce deterrent, run risk people breaching licence conditions, would make overcrowding problem worse? chooses path, consider increasing deterrent effect ensuring, following 28- day return prison, restrictions prisoner' freedom, electronic tagging? certainly hope things looked independent sentencing review. mandating 14- day fixed- term release measure taken previous government. extending 28 days sentences four years situation face, ensure run prison places interim. like, many residents across filton bradly stoke rightly appalled last summer discover real situation left behind conservative party. comes prisons, minister agree opportunity conservative party apologise?. friend makes good point, house heard. minister secretary state often used word “emergency” describe state prison population, asked secretary state long take deport foreign criminals clogging jails. moment secretary state say, “yes, emergency, deport lot, freeing 10, 000 places, would help overcome crisis. deported foreign national offenders 12 months last government previous 12 months, continuing work hard home office deport foreign national offenders. never able scale necessary address challenges face prisons time. recent visit featherstone prison near wolverhampton, came across several prisoners recalled, waiting year cases progressed. minister agree limiting recall sentence, making greater use technology punish offenders community, making probation service effective result better rehabilitation prisoners, reduce reoffending, ease prison overcrowding caused previous government?. friend points actions must take address challenges face system, make system work better victims protect public. many domestic abusers, given nature, welcome opportunity give another twist knife cost mere 28 days. minister presented practical opportunity? carefully gone exclusions measure, emphasised importance good professional bodies continuing apply proper risk assessments. risk assessments say standard recall appropriate fixed- term recall, happen. bit rich conservative members critical left criminal justice system total meltdown.. friend agree tagging important resource protecting public criminals? perhaps saw channel programme “dispatches”, showed contract given serco conservative party totally utterly failing. confidence serco deliver contract,, remove, bring service back public control? clear tagging technology huge potential. recent study shown 20% reduction reoffending offenders wearing curfew tags,. friend right draw attention concerns contract. serco' performance improving, still acceptable. reporting “dispatches” programme last year, knew serious issues, issued financial penalties serco, given contract previous government. serco' performance drops, options remain table. announcement illustration house legislate remove impediments deportation foreign national offenders. reply shadow justice secretary, minister said victims affected policy kept informed release, yet refused say whether department conducted impact assessment. new information today willing commit publishing month, victims indeed kept informed? victims absolutely need kept informed, continue work victims' groups victims' commissioner ensure. separate cases, two families constituency lost loved ones murdered offenders remand never. minister meet, wish, families, assurance lessons learned cases, families placed horrendous situation? sorry hear cases mentioned. friend. happy meet take matter. victims' commissioner warned freeing prisoners early shown pose reoffending risk public “place victims wider public unnecessary risk harm. domestic abuse commissioner said “simply unacceptable”. discussions government two commissioners making announcement? speak victims' commissioner regularly;- secretary state justice,. friend member pontypridd( alex davies- jones), speaking later today. justice secretary could chosen deport thousands offenders jails, maxed court sitting days, repurposed buildings procured temporary facilities hold offenders. instead chosen release serious offenders, including domestic abusers, jail early, consideration victims? releasing people prison earlier. yes,.,. people already served sentence prison; community. breach condition licence, returned prison.. gentleman might well ask government supported take measures mentions. government inherited mess government left, taking decisions address unconscionable threat prison system able lock dangerous people. ministers seem deliberately vague number domestic abuse offenders eligible release, breadth offences. given big announcement, government department done lot work looking eligible. minister set house exact number domestic abuse offenders eligible scheme? hear right. gentleman' question, write. first duty government keep public safe. recently met constituent whose convicted ex- husband serving prison sentence, raped twice. despite prison, continues
