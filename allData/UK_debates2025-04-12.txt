today absolutely right thing, frank, extraordinary find situation sovereign steel industry peril result conservatives' failings labour government trying give unprecedented powers. astounding, even british steel sold £1, even entered insolvency even government' insolvency service temporarily ran, conservatives pressed ahead erect trade barriers botched brexit deal, scrapped industrial strategy council allowed sale steel plant chinese firm, according ministers, refusing negotiate good faith least keep plant going. conservatives asleep wheel. failed tackle energy costs business rates, trump'

outlined—british steel sold pound, british steel entering insolvency government' insolvency service left temporarily running firm—all happened 2019. putin' barbaric war europe donald trump' disastrous tariffs causing economic turmoil around world, must secure future steel production home. liberal democrats welcome sense seriousness urgency shown government recalling. must work together rescue steel sector tens thousands jobs directly indirectly rely. terms bill, secretary state giving huge unconstrained powers could set dangerous precedent. urge make commitment, strongest possible terms, repeal

clause(), indemnities appears give secretary state potentially person him—a police officer, civil servant, border force official—immunity prosecution using wide- ranging powers. powers unprecedented unconstrained. grateful secretary state saying precisely intends repeal soon possible. broadly, government must also bring forward plans guarantee future vital sector. know steel industry surrounded crippling uncertainty. decades underinvestment shocking indifference sovereign economic security, previous conservative government left sovereign national capacity steel diminished endangered. yet chance demand steel disappear. absurd irresponsible sustainable enduring long- term market british steel, supply could keel matter days failures failed conservative party? looking ahead, let remember saving scunthorpe necessary, sufficient. significant discussions future ownership structure company. given precarious fiscal position government find, important options ownership put table, house take informed decision mean public finances. hope government make commitment, coming weeks, bring forward report sets options future ownership plant. looking ahead, many big questions remain unanswered. government immediately designate- made steel nationally strategic asset? using direct reduced iron,,, form part' plans alongside protecting production virgin steel scunthorpe? government bring forward comprehensive plan ensure british steel used vital infrastructure projects, defence renewable energy? ministers work shoulder shoulder european commonwealth partners tear trade barriers, including negotiating customs union 2030? develop initiatives retrain upskill workers across country transition greener methods steel production? government intend respond calls steel government achieve lowest

steel used defence applications, offshoring supply chain may security implications—for example, scenario multiple allied countries rearm simultaneously time global supply disruption, major geopolitical confrontation. fact jingye closed supply raw materials evidence plant sold first place. quite frankly, fact conservative mps calling nationalisation shows far looking glass really. conservatives' attitude abundantly clear? national security, cut troop numbers 10, 000; food security, undermined farmers unforgiveably bad trade deals; economic security, left country almost sovereign steel capacity. security, conservatives left island nation severely vulnerable, like flotsam sea, passively bobbing bashed around tides international events.. members private limited company
