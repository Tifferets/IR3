secretary. government risk downgrading respect convention, given go- ahead action, prime minister reports directly house. also back leading role royal navy continuing defence shipping nations red sea. action government taking persuade countries join prosperity guardian protection force? long defence secretary expect operation prosperity guardian needed? eu' new maritime mission red sea co- ordinate

military action cannot solve problems region. government' diplomatic action pressure houthis cease attacks settle civil war yemen, pressure iran stop supplying weapons intelligence houthis? finally, like defence secretary, totally reject houthi claims firing missiles drones ships around world somehow linked conflict gaza. attacking oil tankers seizing ships least five years—not 121 days since

rather sporadic: attacks, including hms diamond merchant shipping, continued, much ad hoc fashion. perhaps relevant attack using multiple different weapons time, saw, example, 11 january. degrading impact.[ official report, february 2024, vol. 745,. 3mc.]( correction) come back right. gentleman' comments prime minister end—i want set record straight. right. gentleman asked operation prosperity guardian. simple answer, course, none knows long need continue, want come conclusion quickly possible. utterly reject notion continued attacks houthis anything situation gaza. houthis opportunist pirates using situation benefit: years ago, even support hamas, suddenly want greatest champions., 000 kilometres away gaza; simply using situation advantage, wise house- link two. none less, right. gentleman absolutely right need see humanitarian truce sustainable ceasefire—that government' policy. working extremely hard try achieve, including discussions prime minister, foreign secretary. yesterday, discussions middle east. right. gentleman asked raf flights. issue getting aid location—i working closely cypriot government, example, increase amount aid. single biggest problem remains getting aid country. success getting kerem shalom open, really need see ashdod open, order route aid kerem shalom straight gaza. government continue push route, problem flights taking; aid getting. finally, turning fact defence secretary standing dispatch box, rather prime minister, first thing say secretary state defence actually legal responsibility actions—who signs targets, indeed, legal authority. technically, standing, first couple rounds, prime minister dealing something new therefore appropriate dispatch box. wider point would gently make right. gentleman, though, prime minister

northern ireland. would thought house would welcome fact historic breakthrough marked prime minister, appropriate today explain activity saturday night house. government accept difficult deter terrorist fanatics, one mainly contain effectiveness ultimately destroyed, preferably regional allies? secretary state feel fact link separate conflict, conflict ukraine? coincidence proxies russia'

clear official opposition support action, government, learn, benches, remember liberal democrats saying previously. think quite clear strong support house. also important sufficient freedom action ensure safety security airmen women undertake actions, rather flagging substantially advance.. gentleman mentioned—and right. member wentworth dearne( john healey) —the aircraft carrier, address

world- class navy, suffering personnel issues crewing ships, responsibility lies back treasury providing revenue streams needed make sure capital equipment got used effectively. representations right. friend making ensure growth maritime concerns around world met commitment treasury? wider armed forces mod note, £288. billion equipment next 10 years. right. friend absolutely right matched sailors, airmen women army able resource equipment, good news. since talking actively issues, seen eight- year high applications royal navy, six- year high applications army 42% increase january last january applications join royal air force. predict making progress. wonder whether secretary state seen front page financial times today outlines iran using lloyds santander accounts evade sanctions. accusing front companies funding irgc hundreds millions dollars working russian intelligence raise money iranian proxies. sure house would appalled know money laundered capital used troops houthis, assessment government made allegations ally? yet show must proscribe irgc? issue repeatedly raised house. lady know, heard responses many times, routinely comment proscription. case however sanction, sanctioned entirety irgc already, well taken number different actions. appreciate matter come directly within defence portfolio, know opportunity press foreign office home office ministers future time, keep matter constant review. agree secretary state government want see escalation region want proportionate response calibrate response provoke antagonise, case might actually hitting wrong target—that hitting proxies iran, believe peace diplomacy, malevolent factor region,, iran? might case, best diplomatic intentions want provoke iran major conflict nato,, putting decision cost lives future. iran regime—not iranian people regime iran—are behind. ones destabilising israel, abraham accords. hope secretary state take strategic view make hard choices iran,, whether like, coming. right. friend makes excellent point iran behind. iran behind hamas, hezbollah, houthis irgc- aligned militia seen attack american troops—i often hear american personnel attacked 160 separate times syria iraq, fact third occasions involved british troops well. every occasion, iran behind. absolutely agree right. friend working hard pressurise iran realising current approach good destabilise region, claims want. let first make point direct attack iran would insanity; region would provoked others would dragged. understand government saying wise “to- link” houthis strikes gaza, reality middle east region edge conflagration result war going attacks gaza. priority must therefore secure peace gaza. limited role, know netanyahu would secure peace pressurised american government, realistically power influence israeli strategy. talks taken place biden government ensure exercise maximum pressure netanyahu get peace negotiating table? right. gentleman aware, hope, work closely. last week. met blinken, lloyd austin others discuss exactly points right. gentleman raises bring together solution provides, ultimately, palestinian state palestinian people, security guarantees israel. also important realise working closely number different spheres, including lebanese border, working hard try prevent conflict. remember 125, 000 israelis move border activity lebanese hezbollah. working lebanese government. saw yemeni defence minister yesterday, discussed prevent conflict becoming part,. government pulling every single possible diplomatic lever clearly complex position. defence secretary right mission must continue stand defend international laws red sea, mission remove houthi threat keep red sea safe could last months, sustainable continue tasking typhoons cyprus mission subsequent future threats. defence secretary therefore agree case urgent operational requirement upgrade type- 45 destroyers, given continued inability vertical launch systems strike targets range inland? know right. friend takes huge interest matter, interested hear friday hms somerset devonport, fitting surface-- surface system, may may appropriate particular type conflict. want take issue one thing. coalition, working others. demonstrated repeatedly, issue typhoons flying long distance. indeed, carried unrelated attacks tower 22, flew way. flying long distance sign capability. secretary state please another go giving better answer question. member oxford west abingdon( layla moran) extremely serious report today' financial times two' main banks indirectly helping fund houthis, sort conflict? right. gentleman heard answer moment ago. know wants go detail, unable dispatch box right. noted question article morning. also intensely engaged finding best way ensure iranian influence, whether region,

attacks altogether? think clock running houthis, much ability degraded, right. friend points out—they eyes ears radar stations; reliant still iran, done interdictions weapons. limitation. none less, still think would continue, choose, even lower level, important cease stop. putting pressure, described, every possible means, including extensive talks yesterday saudi arabia various different people, including saudis yemenis. secretary state confirm long- term strategy relates ongoing precarious situation yemen? government plan commit sustained military action?, surely right say appropriate way. third time come made statement—i know. lady made contributions debate—so feel fully engaged process. looking make sustained, long- term military action. indeed, guarantee house

acquisition, please confirm house intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition reconnaissance focused houthi capabilities directly engaged attacks international shipping? reasonable assume degradation capabilities result increased security red sea?. friend asks good question yet asked. answer yes. looking carefully, locations chosen occasion indeed combination intelligence. government right strong response may seem many faraway war incident, could impact much people' lives, food shortages, supply chain disruption inflation. given reports shortages royal navy personnel, difficulty munitions, difficulties ships increased demands navy tensions china russia—maybe even argentina future—will secretary state assure capability play part keeping supply chains open? discussions allies get involved task supporting job? right. gentleman right importance trade. 90% goods come country via sea, really matters, matters whole world. mentions personnel, munitions, one two members. time defence secretary, unable deploy exactly needed, example request nato deployed kosovo—they returned home now—or conflict middle east, needed carry actions discussing. occasion, available. previously mentioned £288 billion 10- year programme equipment success recruiting personnel. encourage countries match defence budget, comfortably% gdp heading.% —the sooner, better. fully support government' action red sea. irony iranian regime accusing destabilising region actions lost reasonable people. secretary state agree demonstrators streets london applauding houthi rebels best useful idiots worst truly enemy within? use language, disgraceful see people go support indiscriminately firing merchant ships—that absolutely appalling. repeat. friend' language; put support ignorance rather anything else. secretary state rightly clear breaches international law houthis red sea. equally clear breaches international law sides gaza? think help reduce hostilities across middle east government build broader international coalition support diplomatic military aims? government always want international humanitarian law adhered, make point repeatedly every side conflict. think. gentleman driving

central london, protestors pro- palestinian marches called intifada held deeply racist antisemitic signs, one included informing israelis—we presume jewish israelis—that indigenous nowhere hell. sure ignorance; think something sinister play among protestors. call: pure simple jew hate. secretary state inform house whether spoken anyone else across government action deal hate streets? home secretary continuously keeps matter review, meets police chiefs ensure powers combat. friend rightly describes absolutely disgusting behaviour, place streets. sure whole house needs reminding, perhaps people go campaigning: houthis' slogan “death, death israel, death jews matter. place streets. extraordinary situation secretary state comes, makes matter-- fact statement launch missiles number targets countries, gives indication long- term war aim present, says absolutely nothing crying, desperate need ceasefire protect people gaza death destruction. realise extension conflict least four countries risks huge conflagration across whole region? would much happier come said determined try deal injustices region bring peace process rather militarisation seaways around countries. surely
