things—but honestly say simply cannot see house pass piece legislation house, vague hope somehow better make changes become workable piece legislation, private member' bill. government introduce bill like, would see great deal input huge amount checking bodies. example, told second reading safeguards protections sending committee would somehow become robust strongest world. fact, committee got weakened, strengthened, problem. right. gentleman give way point?. lady forgive, understand many others want speak, going make bit progress mind. important point, think vote today, behaviour professional bodies consulted, come part strongly opposed legislation. every medical college retained neutral position. count—[ interruption.] go. count, two three medical colleges said expressly

legislation. well say, appreciate right say, hope gets speak later, agree. said earlier debate, whole issue mental capacity dealt properly structure bill.. member spen valley talked earlier, absolutely right. even amendments proposed always accepted, left areas deeply troubling. simply cannot accept lords must make changes, make first. key. one big important area here—i absolutely agree constituency neighbour health secretary this—is talk lot choice dying, choice informed palliative care simply good enough?, mother house spoke, many people affected: vulnerable; people furthest away

internationally—canada, oregon various places—where legislation slides slides amendments made things workable. doubt, simply say. third reading; second reading—it “in principle” debate. debate, decide whether send unworkable piece legislation another place, unelected, make decision cannot come conclusion. cannot let go. rise speak support bill third reading, heart terminally ill adults: people dying; people less six months live; people tried stay alive, beat terrible disease expert medical treatment, avail. face inevitable: die. fact, thing know ever, really. sure think desire peaceful, pain- free death slip sleep ripe old age, lived good life, reality citizens—those legislate place—could face painful undignified death. believe 21st century, like growing number countries, change law permit choice end life—or rather, choice towards end death—so dying people opt death manner choosing element control last days. yougov polling published yesterday showed public—the citizens serve—back, 75% supporting assisted dying principle 73% supporting bill stands. co- sponsor bill, served bill committee, pleased scrutiny, challenge debate almost piece legislation—over 100 hours,

judicial oversight decision making range experts, including psychiatrists, social workers senior legal professionals. bill set statutory protections workers wish take part assisted dying process basis conscience, quite right. bill provide one tightest, safest assisted dying laws world. importantly, bill compassion core affording dying people choice end life. thank every one constituents shared views, whether change law. particularly thank disagreed, good democracy right disagree respectfully hugely important; perhaps debate another time. also thank shared personal stories loved ones' deaths, brutal, painful traumatic—a stark reminder status quo simply unacceptable. others shared experiences loved ones, jurisdictions, australia, able peaceful death, surrounded loved ones time choosing. come close, although everyone would want choose assisted death, believe everyone opportunity choose one wish. really time house takes important, compassionate humane step towards making reality voting terminally ill adults( end life) bill. four- minute speech—thank much. call father house. served many years right. member hackney north stoke newington( abbott), dare say, agreed everything years, published articles topic. articles always started fundamental principle nhs. us—maybe included—have rather critical nhs years, least go nhs, know everybody really trying best preserve life. fundamental principle. reason right. lady oppose bill, said several times, talking principle; talking actual bill. know people criticise say, “oh, would oppose, religious views rest. actually, take quite sensible, hope, pragmatic approach. listened debates, heard many harrowing stories people' last hours. think treat people sides argument respect, understand points view, respect dignity dying people. always taken view open debate. actually, brought forward ten- minute rule bill—which course objected half- past afternoon—saying full study, led department health social care, health professionals, work help people final hours. many hospices care homes, talked many palliative care specialists assure resources skills nowadays make final hours pain- free bearable, heard testimony others saying possible. could convince extreme cases people dying agony, totally lacking dignity final hours, would listen arguments, think bill today. therefore urge members remember voting bill, think bill riddled difficulties inconsistencies. think subject human rights legislation. difficult argue ask somebody assist person' death within six months dying cancer—although universal testimony acceptance work six months—but suffering appalling degenerative disease quadriplegic quality life. think actually argument, pass bill today, move direction canada death demand. end point. voting bill, pause moment think, “wouldn’t better? heard many hours abortion bill, universality clinical acceptance. vote bill, think ask health department profound knowledgeable study, working royal colleges, whether possible decent palliative care, wonderful hospices, hospitals? doubt recent years, particularly since shipman, fear among many nhs health professionals providing degree palliative care—that degree morphine, fentanyl hugely effective modern drugs., pause think. voting principle; come back,, later date, get consensus really good bill allow everybody die dignity. speak briefly cover three points. expect persuade committed opposing bill change minds; hope persuade supporting change. time put concluded thoughts record seeking lordships' opinions. start finished speech second reading: agency. since debate last november, continued meet constituents sides argument, answered hundreds letters emails—i sure. members done. met mainly groups oppose bill, including faith groups, sought change mind. changed mind. still driven plight suffering unnecessarily end life. wholly respect decision would want assisted dying, cannot accept right deny choice would, profound reasons, use provisions bill end lives. pain, suffering, indignity degradation slow, painful, tortured death something none would wish friend relative—on anyone. suffering end life, narrow circumstances prescribed bill, avoided, deny?. friend give way? going give way. obvious qualification clear personal choice leave life matter time one' choosing risk coercion, rightly dominated much debate past eight months. two points made. first, great effort expended, reflected amendments bill, make safeguards comprehensive watertight possible, learning going beyond practice jurisdictions. compliance provisions bill rigorous process, also practical one; designed transparent test intent person seeking assisted death. secondly, say still enough, comparing? answer best, cases, status quo, may involve investigation post mortem whether assistance given—putting caring loved one risk prosecution, nothing prevent malign intent. finally, although tried see sides every issue, one point opponents bill, opinion, wrong: whether bill, thus far, seen due process. month 20 years, think bills length scope received much scrutiny many hours committee, much evidence submitted comment made. members vote bill many reasons, even though restrict choice others. compare regime pre post legislation, hope, decide bill gives greater protection. ask vote lacked time information make decision—we not—or country ability resource
