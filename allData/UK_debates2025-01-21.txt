terrorism policing jointly commissioned immediate prevent learning review summer, publish detailed findings following sentencing. three referrals took place three four years southport attack, including following evidence rudakubana expressing interest school shootings, london bridge attack, ira, mi5 middle east. occasion, rudakubana' case assessed counter- terrorism policing, instance onward referral specialist channel support. learning review concluded referrals closed, cases, given perpetrator' age complex needs, referred channel. concludes much weight placed absence ideology, without considering vulnerabilities radicalisation, taking account whether “obsessed massacre extreme violence”, cumulative significance three repeat referrals properly considered. prevent programme vital national security officers work huge dedication keep safe, need effective. changes already made since 2021, including new prevent duty guidance, new training frontline workers radicalisation

disgrace must change. bring stronger measures tackle knife sales online crime policing bill spring. thirdly, prime minister set morning, need ensure laws keep changing violent extremist threats face. police cps decide whether individual cases meet definition set terrorism act 2000 making charges, given growing number cases perpetrators seeking terrorise, even without clear ideology, need ensure law, powers sentencing strong enough cope. therefore asked independent reviewer terrorism powers examine legislation area light modern threats face. finally, let address issue contempt court. british
