others, dog cat offer much- needed companionship may otherwise. saw social personal benefit animal ownership throughout pandemic,. million pets purchased periods lockdown. lacking social interaction instead facing social isolation, individuals families alike sought great companionship pets provide. nation' love affection feline canine friends mind, believe bill' provisions welcomed many constituents. understand importance bill, essential understand current issues around puppy, kitten ferret smuggling. currently, animals enter country two primary ways: non- commercial rules pet travel scheme, via commercial importation regime. pet travel rules made travelling pets cheaper easier owners. however, non- commercial rules abused puppy kitten smugglers, particularly care health welfare animals, financial reward exploitative practice. traders fraudulently claimed pet ownership numerous puppies kittens import animals non- commercial rules pet travel scheme, yet puppies kittens commercially sold upon importation. requirements owners travelling pet less stringent commercial import, rightly so—that perfectly understandable. smugglers therefore sought abuse pet travel importation route circumvent stringent health regulations animals. health welfare puppies, kittens ferrets frequently compromised pets illegally smuggled. suggested outlined sheer number pets country, demand cats dogs extremely high. demand young puppies kittens high- value breeds similarly high,, sadly, demand animals certain mutilations. cropped- ear dogs declawed cats demand, despite illegality mutilations country. sheer demand dogs cats types, coupled demand dogs cats illegal mutilations law, encouraged abuse animal importation rules. less stringent regulation, pet importation feigned, health welfare imported animals suffered. 2021, almost, 000 dogs cats detained non- compliant existing animal health welfare legislation, number identified imported animals. illicit industry, true figure could well far higher. issues mind welcome bill' provisions, offer far greater protection health welfare dog, cats ferrets imported country. measures outlined eminently sensible. address abuse non- commercial importation rules, understanding bill reduce number animals travel non- commercial rules five per person five per vehicle, three per foot passenger air passenger. right, smugglers benefiting non- commercial pet importation rules, reducing number one person claim pet travelling impinge fraudulent use importation route associated health welfare costs puppy smuggling system. broadly, bill' provisions put place higher health welfare standards imported puppies kittens. banning import puppies kittens six months age seems reasonable separating puppies kittens mothers early carries risk illness even death young animals. know separation puppies mothers advisable eight weeks exactly reasons., illegal licence holder sell puppy pet permanently separate biological mother eight weeks; may choose sell litter family pet, consensus among many welfare veterinary organisations, animal welfare foundation, blue cross, pdsa dogs trust, puppies separated age. emotional physical distress experienced mother puppy immense, fatal, behavioural consequences animals throughout lives. week puppy spends mother crucial social behavioural development. bite inhibition gentle play taught environment essential puppy rehomed. recognition harm kittens separated mothers young age also already recognised legislation. country illegal licensed breeder sell kitten age eight weeks age. recent months place shown great concern possession dangerous dogs pose risk public health. ensuring suitable age imported dogs welfare animals therefore equally high priority house. prevent proliferation dangerous dog population, need prevent importation animals higher risk displaying dangerous behavioural traits. include prohibiting young puppies without behavioural maturity bite inhibition learn mothers. bill' provision ban importation puppies, kittens ferrets age six months positive step towards greater animal welfare standards towards reducing population dangerous dogs may pose threat public health.. friend making excellent, thoughtful well- researched speech. agree need greater public information education, previously mentioned debate, reduce risk young age puppies sold? thank. friend considered intervention agree wholeheartedly need make sure public information education improved. many people understand impact possible implications taking young puppy kitten early. often goodness heart, best intentions wanting look young puppy kitten get one children, need ensure people aware long- term often permanent damage done young puppies kittens way. removing ability import puppies kittens age six months, likely remove incentive animals stripped mothers critically young age thus reduce numbers puppies kittens suffering health welfare consequences premature separation. also prohibit import dogs cats mutilated, several members talked. animals often suffered trauma unnecessary procedures ear cropping tail docking. mutilations health benefits; abusive practices recognised law illegal. offer emotional physical trauma animals inflicted. preventing importation animals traumatic mutilations also prevent importation animals, result physical emotional trauma caused mutilations, develop behavioural changes. dogs cropped ears docked tails may recognised certain members public aggressive dangerous. hear regularly—or rate, surgeries. people keep pets away animals, often fear aggression towards dogs, animals suffer lack socialisation behaviour worsen. similarly, banning imports dogs cats mutilations protect puppies kittens harmful practices, hopefully instigate decline demand pets certain physical characteristics. illegal import puppy cropped ears, common sense incentive crop puppy' ears location origin diminished. cannot imported sold legally, logical conclude characteristic lose value importer. may also hope criminalisation certain mutilations reduce demand practices consumer, along education referred. friend member reading east( matt rodda). place, frequently hear argument criminalisation activity may increase attractiveness engaging whatever criminalised, case animal welfare find argument particularly convincing. nation animal lovers, believe following criminalisation certain mutilations, wanting buy puppy kitten may understand better harm associated practices choose shun imported animals. ban mutilations damaging, fashion like. whose conscience prohibit requiring mutilated puppy kitten, recognition pet' becoming illegal future might. hope importer consumer discouraged mutilating acquiring mutilated animals respectively. legal importation disappear, may hope—optimistically—that illegal smuggling trade face several disruptions, broader recognition harm mutilated animals endured.. friend making excellent speech. agree although many learnt great deal practices, courtesy. member north devon( selaine saxby), wider public aware consequences? could government much inform public practices support wider

congratulate. member north devon enabling presenting bill. proposed banning import heavily pregnant dogs cats another provision help protect animal health welfare. plans seeking circumvent new rules limiting number animals imported non- commercial rules would scuppered. seeking abuse laws always try find new ways sustain exploitative operations way, bill, well thought, offers great two- layer protection puppies kittens. let imagine scenario puppy smuggler wanted import several puppies kittens, guise animals pets. limit legal importation animals non- commercial rules aeroplane would three. cognisant limit, smuggler could sought import heavily pregnant dog cat would give birth numerous puppies kittens could sold. practice would limited, provision banning import heavily pregnant dogs cats. puppy smuggler could simply travel heavily pregnant dog cat guise pet ownership animal give birth commercial opportunity. crucially, bill also support health welfare pregnant cats dogs, pets suffer greatly international travel heavily pregnant. physical emotional upheaval long- haul travel prompt early labour without necessary veterinary care, therefore carries risks harm death mother puppies kittens involved. reviewing specifics bill preparation debate, astonished find provisions already enshrined legislation. sensible considered measures see little downside, well supported others outside place. support bill garnered animal welfare stakeholders charities demonstrates benefit provisions could health welfare puppies kittens. rspca, dogs trust battersea dogs cats home support
