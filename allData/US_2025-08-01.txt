prc), toward trusted allies proven mainline capacity, japan south korea. measure directly responds real- world consequences gaping loopholes merchant marine act 1920, better known jones act, restricts domestic shipping including routes west coast hawaii vessels- built,- flagged,- owned- crewed. rationale ancient outdated restriction always argued national security, maintain strong shipbuilding industry merchant fleet capable supporting military times conflict. today argument, merit, dangerously undermined, adversaries, companies benefiting monopolistic protections jones act. specifically, jones act loopholes allow supposedly minor parts fabrication supposedly minor repairs conducted foreign shipyards using foreign workers condition restriction country. minor parts whole sections, minor repairs full retrofits. preferred source fabrication repairs peoples republic china( prc). jones act vessels daniel. inouye, kaimana hila manukai undergone major structural conversions, including

mere`` major modifications avoid triggering 50 percent import duty intended disincentivize foreign work. ais data, company filings, coast guard correspondence even photographs confirm anything routine. poses significant immediate national security concern. first, enabling vessels critical domestic supply chains undergo major upgrades foreign- controlled shipyards adversaries, introduce unnecessary strategic risk. ships support domestic commerce, also arguably constitute backbone sealift capacity would required military mobilization. second, continued outsourcing vessel modification construction undermines shipbuilding repair base, leaving fewer 100 jones act-- compliant vessels active service nationwide, many aging specialized. third, sends dollars, jobs technological investments directly hands strategic competitor identified national defense strategy significant long- term challenge interests. nowhere consequences policy failure acute strategically dangerous home state hawaii. located middle indo- pacific, hawaii remote island economy dependent maritime commerce. linchpin power projection force posture across indo- pacific. disruption hawaiis shipping system economic risk residents direct vulnerability americas strategic readiness. moreover, jones act supporters continue claim law protects jobs, evidence says otherwise. according grassroot institute hawaii, maritime employment shipbuilding repair sector declined 15 percent past 23 years. steady erosion due foreign competition alone, deliberate business decisions jones act carriers choose take advantage legal loopholes let outsource high- value work overseas still reaping benefits domestic protectionism. despite clear defects law, hawaii islands noncontiguous parts country remain fully captive market, viable alternatives jones act duopoly prioritizes profit preparedness. see meaningful return federal maritime policy. economic burden broken system, including inflated shipping costs driven duopoly protections foreign outsourcing, borne daily hawaiis families businesses. previously introduced three separate measures address specific consequences. overall answer country national security risk force fabrication, repair operation exclusively country since compounds problem cant effectively fix. instead cease rewarding adversaries start incentivizing international friends allies assist domestic merchant marine related defense sealift needs. merchant marine allies partnership act addresses problems targeted, security- conscious realignment incentives. specifically, bill exempts current 50 percent import duty major vessel modifications work performed shipyards located allied partner countries, japan south korea-- nations world- class maritime industries deep national security alignment. allows ships constructed allied countries qualify domestic( coastwise) trade limited jones act exemption, thereby expanding access modern, secure cost- effective vessels without subsidizing adversarial economies. finally, legislation establishes regulated pathway foreign- built, foreign- crewed vessels operated companies allied nations participate coastwise trade clearly defined national security safeguards. legislation repeal abandon jones act. restores law intended purpose-- serve foundation national resilience, industrial strength strategic security, rather hijacked hypocritical umbrella national defense expense increased costs consumer goods across country. recognizes modern maritime commerce global, global alignment must rooted trust, shared values
