published judgment rosebank jackdaw oil gas fields north sea. judgment set previous consents granted rosebank jackdaw unlawful, failed take account emissions burning fuel produced. result, developers wish proceed projects, need reapply consent, time considering scope emissions, required supreme court judgment last year. although judgment matter courts, government taken rapid action. early january,
