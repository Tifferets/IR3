accommodate significant minority displaced independent schools—places bristol bedford, salford richmond, worcester wycombe, bury north bolton north east. let clear: local authorities duty find spaces children. take duty seriously, number considerably worried may happen.- year admissions especially complicated case: involve governors fair access protocol panel, ultimately, secretary state direction, add months school. creating additional physical space schools obviously takes time, building new schools takes longer still. time needed adjust, motion calls government “postpone imposition vat charge schools areas state schools relevant key stage already average” almost full. government barely feet table, already government chaos. chaos exemplified destructive, disruptive divisive education tax interrupt learning; create place demand cannot accommodated; put strain send system; hit specific groups ought trying protect; likely generate much lower revenue anticipated; quite possibly even end net cost public purse. headlong rush make political statement, government appear simply thought consequences. call announce immediately abandoning unrealistic january implementation date, publish proper impact assessment, entirely rethink entirely counterproductive tax.
