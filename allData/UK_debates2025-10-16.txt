emphasise government committed pursuing positive relationship china strengthen understanding cooperation stability national security adviser think good idea include statement national security adviser reflecting government policy time choice words decision include look across statements see broad consistency material difference policy relating china pretty much shared across house clear crown prosecution service asked government year additional evidence cps considered crucial question whether china constituted national security threat relevant period seems read statements least two important questions arise first one asked member widnes halewood derek twigg given clear point national security adviser made second third statements question asked comment whether bar national security threat met possible relevance inclusion information china economic opportunity surely minister government see weakens substance question witness asked answer would useful understand whether dnsa came view suggested would useful thing include second question government clear minister today prime minister yesterday disappointed outcome trial much wanted prosecution proceed given length time number requests received cps surely would logical assume government would straining every sinew find extra evidence meet cps requirement whether thought cps right ask clear extra evidence cps would proceeded case government say wanted evidence government provide every sinew strained everything could find evidence evidence fact available others could find government explaining thank right learned gentleman tone question first point interruption sorry remind first question national security adviser included reference economic opportunity statement knew question asked relevant question sorry thank right learned gentleman done provide broader context government position china time independent decision taken freely without interference ministers advisers dsna interruption position account decision evidence submitted consecutive governments afraid add point may take minister back wording act says offence pass information would directly indirectly useful enemy say offence directly indirectly pass enemy information would useful difference first usefulness information constitutes offence might passed unauthorised person second passing enemy constitutes offence using second interpretation therefore possible argue unless person information passed enemy offence committed would seem two men case dropped fact passing person authorised receive friend foe allowed circulate outside government control could obtained used enemy surely act sought criminalise minister agrees satisfied wording act think prosecution dropped erroneously commenting whether dropped erroneously something minister would dispatch box would like make broader point china activities related application super embassy currently government desk minister says acknowledged china threat actively working undermine national security secretary state housing communities local government said government would never compromise national security government give consideration approving chinese super embassy would give extraordinary capability china continue expand espionage activities target hongkongers british soil transnational repression gentleman says decision chinese embassy
