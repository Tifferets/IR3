market. suggested none clear yesterday, made crystal clear. world leader, announced £20 billion ccus.. gentleman remember, around long time, 2003 labour government said carbon capture, utilisation storage urgent route 2050 without, proceeded nothing. government getting. putting money mouth developing technologies carbon capture hydrogen, way labour government failed do—as renewables, boot. talk climate, truth greatest climate risk country right. member doncaster north( edward miliband) destroys market starts state- run quango, wreck renewables growth seen. welcome announcement. independent committee climate change recognises need unabated gas electricity market right 2035 beyond, widely even 2050, 25% energy needs come hydrocarbons. right. friend agree exactly right way maintain lower energy production costs, still meeting net zero targets? agree. friend. point wide range back- capacity, use much fossil fuels,, think long case, ensure new gas generation carbon capture- ready. look forward hydrogen- ready,. similar position germany countries looking exactly. instance, think germany ireland, part growth renewables, recognise need gas, albeit used less less, ensure lights stay appropriate insurance place. call snp spokesperson. cluster—it unbelievable situation. secretary state' letter members today, said government taking steps make sure lights stay. legacy 14 years conservatives charge energy. uncomfortably, find agreement right. member north east somerset( jacob rees- mogg). significant departure, one alarmed. government' precious nuclear baseload? exemplar ccus working necessary scale, government taking inspiration? would elegant solution unabated gas winding time battery storage long- duration pump storage winding? cannot, government dragged feet things. minister say people infrastructure transmission put throughout communities told suck need get gas system, government building gas- fired power stations?. gentleman, supposed lead subject party, listened said earlier. 2022, 38% generation came gas. mid- 2030s,%%.? balance renewables growing, particularly scotland, support scottish jobs. course put generation scotland demand south, provide connecting infrastructure. previous generations wire become rich prosperous country today. need. working local communities, listening voices making sure misled people come nonsense. gentleman. commend right. friend refreshingly clear articulation strong record area, house today media yesterday. obviously, security supply must come first. plans incentivise investment back- gas- fired power stations, minimising costs consumers, also important? thank. friend. right. friend member north east somerset( jacob rees- mogg) absolutely right focus economics. get economics right. used auction- type mechanism capacity market ensure flexible capacity. incentivising low carbon, batteries coming scale, well pumps potentially hydrostorage. also need hydrogen carbon capture. ensuring balanced system discipline built drive costs. cbams come stream, firmly expect 2030s lower- cost energy neighbours, right. friend member north east somerset referred, economically competitive. call chair energy security net zero committee. thank, speaker—tapadh leibh. concerning announced chatham house house, secretary state today.- piste speeches cost past. committee heard morning energy minister made speech decade ago, effect investment, cost, 000 jobs. minister says consultation, government picked winner? room given storage mix? confusing energy security—we learned ukraine war important is—with continual electricity supply? given minister says percentage gas used 2030, percentage capacity provide, percentage envisage used day day? thought given consideration technologies gigawatt demand? thank. gentleman question. suggested, different scenarios,%% total generation coming gas future, compared 38% 2022, annualised basis. clearly,. gentleman know better anybody deep knowledge subject, based intermittency. depends much sun shines much wind blows, ensure robust system. exactly. would love people could celebrate country' global leadership fact driving forward, especially members green party, supposed care climate change. way maintains security supply, bringing renewables, lowest- cost flexible system back, economical fashion. welcome announcement today. pure common sense. wind blowing sun shining, need security supply. although need deal climate change medium long term, must also deal security supply short term, welcome announcement. minister agree medium longer- term security supply, must upscale hydrogen sector, hydrogen production usage, world leader hydrogen? moment, slipping behind bit. agree. friend importance hydrogen. disagree, seen projects hydrogen allocation round 1—eight projects, think—i think indication slipping behind. truth whole world needs, everyone' analysis, international energy agency climate change committee department, suggests hydrogen carbon capture necessary bring decarbonised system seek. absolutely right importance hydrogen. expect developments, country leading, ccus. great deal respect minister knowledge subject, fact, like chamber, recognises need cut carbon. sure one, like right. member north east somerset, would follow flat earthers. clearly, great deal trust reliance put carbon capture storage, hydrogen. still quite new technologies. talked stuff 25 years. minister seemingly forgets government power past 14 years still blocks hydrogen carbon capture storage. case government taking position nod wink gas oil industries whose support probably need election year, part whole agenda placating right wing party?. gentleman nearly way. right: whole world looking carbon capture hydrogen, science says. everybody analyses says need bur yet great level maturity. many areas, country leading way. cut emissions anyone else. knows dire legacy left party 2010, less% electricity renewables, appalling, real danger go back. gas power back-, completely sound system. seek deliver decarbonised system 2035. biggest risk would right. member doncaster north come start mess system lifted back front climate leadership. real danger, need avoid. right. friend stop south derbyshire, specifically willington site, already planning permission new gas power station, cut ribbon opens? want spades ground, welcome announcement. invite come look site, ready go. agree. friend applaud investing system. made one investable countries world clean energy. gas important part play balance, development carbon capture hydrogen every opportunity assets even longer life green fashion. would love come see. friend. oil gas energy sources past, need intermittent energy source. gas power plants intermittent. sit, much renewable energy shut, gas—the carbon energy—continues flow. reality today: wasting renewable energy. government recognise reality, respond. question, however. many times ministers met representatives oil gas industry, compare number meetings representatives renewables industry? often—the. lady spectacularly well—she completely utterly wrong. renewables turned, would say, constraints within system, gas turned system could cope otherwise. transmission acceleration action plan connections action plan.[ interruption.] every time try build infrastructure,. member angus( dave doogan) opposes. says scottish national party want friend renewables industry scottish jobs, opposes infrastructure required. question? meet representatives oil gas industry lot, truth even given world leadership—and cut emissions major economy planet—75% primary energy today still oil gas. still dependent oil gas 2050, net zero. crazy opposition parties, including. lady, believe opposing licences actually dependent product. ending licences would lead loss british jobs import higher- emission products abroad. really hope opposition members think bit deeply hear common sense. hear corridors back benchers, front benchers. lady hear nothing nonsense. welcome policy decision, recognition reality. minister confirm new plants able convert low- carbon alternatives future? thank. friend. legislating precisely create exactly obligation carbon capture/ hydrogen readiness. hope decision indicative realisation seems slowly dawning government impact madness net zero policy, damaged economy. higher electricity prices g7 countries, lost vast numbers jobs energy- intensive industries, recognised intermittency wind solar risk blackouts. welcome common- sense decision, given going use gas power stations, minister take next logical step legislate allow tap vast gas resources? shown, would bring prices, give energy security, make economy competitive. right. gentleman could wrong: record levels employment, overtook france recently become eighth largest manufacturer world. would expect join dismal party opposite talking country. truth, leading world tackling climate change, created jobs time british history. going forward 2030s, harnessing british low- carbon, renewable energy lower bills families increase competitiveness. said, world increasingly recognising need action seeking introduce measures carbon border adjustment mechanism—effectively, carbon taxes border—the pole position grow already strong economic position even stronger one result net zero policies government. across london south- east, many much- needed developments required increasing population literally frozen lack supply grid. nuclear power provide baseload; renewables unreliable, obviously gas required peak times particular. right. friend agree topping grid peak times, people want use electricity, gas fastest way bring power station grid also fastest shut?. friend aware work speed transmission. halving timeline 12 14 years seven, connections action plan already moved forward connection dates projects amounting 40 gw. putting lot work across piece. gas capability back-, usage emissions resulting fall precipitately next 10 years, celebrate. years delaying meaningful investment clean, cheaper, reliable renewable energy technologies tidal long- duration pumped hydro storage, surprise government scramble create new dirty gas- powered plants. much department estimate new plants cost, suggesting built, minister mean carbon- capture- ready? mean carbon- capture- operational? hear, hear. tell! said, legislation come forward-- distant future,. lady able scrutinise it—but extraordinary say country whose renewable energy generation risen less% approaching 50% gone slow renewables. decarbonised power system faster major economy planet. reality denial hear scottish national party quite extraordinary.. lady highlighted tidal energy. well, guess country world uses tidal energy. right. member orkney shetland( carmichael), one greatest champions tidal, could tell. lady, really ignorant. fellow scottish mp, could tell tidal deployment nation. proud, proud transformation, time snp labour party stopped misleading people house. minister said earlier faced climate challenge, struggling words describe facing. government join global consensus admit facing climate emergency? secretary- general nations said, year climate warming era climate burning. unlike. gentleman, primarily concerned words—i primarily concerned action—but fact use “emergency” word. know whether broke golden rule says ministers use, treat emergency. see world warming, see negative impacts climate change, spend every single day feeling proud part department decarbonising country faster world.. gentleman get away rhetoric start focus action. thank minister answers. certainly urge prioritise net zero promises, grateful government taking back- precautions consideration. minister often recognised responding questions, northern ireland plays important role contribution meeting net zero targets. therefore ensure northern ireland prioritised leading location new gas- powered stations built?. gentleman sometimes gives impression would like running energy system northern ireland, devolved—and ministers, cause celebration. work closely ministers northern ireland, ministers devolved administrations, meet net zero targets, northern ireland must deliver targets. scotland deliver targets, wales. must work together, spirit collaboration.,. gentleman persuade right. friend member east antrim( sammy wilson), sitting beside, done way strengthens economy well, really something celebrate. permission,, shall make statement post office legislation horizon redress schemes. pleased able announce today introducing new bill quash convictions postmasters england wales affected horizon scandal. set written statement last month, legislation quash convictions meet clear set conditions. scope convictions quashed day new legislation brought force. subject parliamentary passage, aim royal assent received soon possible summer recess. accept, always clear, legislation may overturn convictions people guilty genuine wrongdoing, believe price worth paying ensure many innocent people exonerated. however, government seek mitigate risk people receiving financial redress wronged. government also accept legislation unprecedented. exceptional response factually exceptional situation. want clear set precedent, neither criticism judiciary courts, dealt swiftly matters brought. fact remains, however, three years first convictions overturned, around 100 quashed. without government intervention, many convictions could overturned, either evidence long lost, quite simply, postmasters lost faith state criminal justice system, come forward seek justice. legislation apply england wales. however, fully committed working scottish government northern ireland executive regular, weekly official- level engagement progress approaches. met counterparts scottish government northern ireland executive offer support address concerns, meetings. financial redress scheme open applicants throughout, convictions overturned. thank business trade committee, recently published report includes recommendations government regarding horizon redress. respond usual way, today would like address two committee' recommendations. first responsibility redress lie post office, subject independent oversight—something also recommended horizon compensation advisory board. announce today department business trade, rather post office, responsible delivery redress overturned convictions. final decisions redress made independent panels independent individuals. permission,, shall return house later date provide details intend deliver redress convictions overturned bill via subsequent measures taken scotland northern ireland. discussing details advisory board. financial secretary treasury,. friend member mid worcestershire( nigel huddleston), introduce legislation make payments made via new scheme exempt tax. secondly, select committee recommended government introduce legally binding timeframes deliver redress sub- postmasters, financial penalties non- compliance. strongly support committee' desire speed redress, feel proposed regime would opposite impact. would potentially mean imposing penalties forensic accountants others helping postmasters prepare claims. would probably cause withdraw work, would slow delivery redress. furthermore, want position rushing postmasters major decisions claims offers receive, would possibly mean timed redress altogether. advisory board said “strong view” “this would backward step”, passed legislation less two months ago remove arbitrary deadline group litigation order scheme. want reverse change. however, government acting ensure redress delivered quickly possible. first, working claimants' lawyers reduce number cases require expert evidence—for example, forensic accountants—or medical evidence, delays claims. pilot approach, assuming pilot succeeds, hope expand rapidly. secondly, advisory board asked monthly reports scheme. come schemes' independent case managers, managers place. publish reports, give best basis assess measures speeding redress. finally, introducing optional fixed- sum awards. january, government announced would offer optional fixed- sum award £75, 000 group litigation order scheme. march, 110 offers accepted, 100 people taken £75, 000 fixed payment. accepted fixed payment, three quarters new claimants, fixed offer already meant 100 claims resolved promptly. cases, people got would asked. fixed offer also helpful effect claims, substantially reduces work small claims claimants' lawyers, making resource available progress larger claims quickly. pleased announce today £75, 000 fixed- sum award offer extended horizon shortfall scheme, ensure everyone treated fairly across schemes. already settled claim £75, 000 offered top- bring total redress amount;, 000 postmasters benefit quickly announcement. mindful claims submitted glo scheme swiftly would like. already announced optional fixed- sum award £75, 000, ensure get help claimants quickly, announce today anyone chooses take offer, instead submits full claim individual assessment, interim payment topped £50, 000 straight away. many postmasters' lives ruined horizon scandal, working hard deliver redress. set williams inquiry, discover truth. provide fair financial redress promptly, exonerate unjustly convicted crimes commit. commend statement house. call shadow minister. thank minister advance sight statement. respond, would like put record deep disappointment minister' comments morning “bbc breakfast”. failed categorically condemn tory party donor frank hester' horrific racist remarks right. member hackney north stoke newington( abbott). despite. 10 finally, much delay, describing remarks “racist wrong”, minister appeared contradict position morning. point order,. statement post office legislation. may respectfully say. lady saying irrelevant statement? shadow minister moving. move. simply hope minister reflect reversal statement gave morning, took position would take donation donor. hope reflects impact issue many. turn today' crucial statement. horizon scandal truly shocking, one devastating miscarriages justice british history. scandal brought devastation lives hundreds falsely convicted sub- postmasters. 20 years, families still suffer consequences trauma put. pay tribute determination pursuing justice, alan bates sub- postmasters pioneered campaign worked tirelessly seek justice. without bravery perseverance, campaign would today. also pay tribute right. friend member
