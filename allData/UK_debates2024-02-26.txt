let come together week work ceasefire observed sides, build political process needed secure lasting peace, two- state solution, palestine israel. grateful right. gentleman' comments. asked series questions, respond directly. effectiveness, believe set attacks effective, early reconnaissance shows much, outlined statement. ever, take days get full picture, reason think action entirely successful. much intend attacks houthi infrastructure deterrent. houthis think continue actions; strikes ensure understand consequences actions price pay, perhaps people, controlling waterways, also understand world simply stand back allow actions take place. right. gentleman asks prime minister coming house. gently point, technically, wrong; defence secretary legal authority sign actions, part royal prerogative. legally, responsibility attacks, although, rightly points, prime minister came house give first two statements. message statements similar legal responsibility, seems proper right come house respond questions. full statements round attacks. shadow defence secretary quite right say sits within much wider diplomatic context. went detail comments, happy talk wider work going region try bring successful conclusion wider conflict,, view—and think heard say view—nothing houthis attacking shipping red sea. finally, would gently say—although many snp here—that claim house passed full agreement particular resolution last week little bit rich given circumstances. call chair defence committee. open source information suggests strikes diminishing capability houthis attack international shipping. welcome important, secretary state concur also assessment? welcome aspides prosperity guardian co- ordinating, also include interdiction weapons smuggled iran yemen? right.

relatively short, gap fourth round longer., wait see response. interdictions: yes, certainly continue try ensure iran resupplying. single best message go house iran stop activity. worth noting interdictions past years—and, course, continue. call snp spokesperson. first, let thank secretary state due sight statement. think, opposition party, would give tentative support. shadow defence secretary said possible mission creep give concern, sure role opposition keep asking questions. secretary state knows last question regarding issue position people' republic china. recently, exports europe china excess £400 billion year, doubt suffer result extended time takes travel china europe, beggars belief china' utter silence relation going on—notably, given military naval capacity djibouti. secretary state disagree issue gaza. secured real vote last week, would probably seen recorded formally house. gerald. feierstein, former diplomat, said “the houthis' effort insert gaza conflict” aimed “strengthening support base country cementing movement firmly the… ‘axis resistance’”. wonder whether, like, secretary state concerned strengthening axis resistance, illicit chinese russian support, broadening red sea. thank. member his—as described it—tentative support. noted house largely unified issue past four statements, following previous attacks. asks mission creep

shipping.. member asks china russia say agree; important countries impacted this—the entire world, perhaps china particular—do speak. would welcome china vocal situation. mentioned comments, chinese vessel attacked, direct concern country. call china, course, russia—for worth—to vocal issues. lastly, accept gaza- houthi connection. remind house houthis hamas 2015, arrive scene pretend support. opportunist thugs taking advantage situation people' lives misery—not gaza yemen—and stop desist immediately. secretary state recall, handling topic february, strongly endorsed suggestion lot trouble middle east linked tactics divert war ukraine. given route happening ukraine happening middle east via russia iran, satisfied inconsistency tough line taken ministry defence houthis soft line taken

case probably lost control. important deliver messages many different ways iranians. seen read- outs ways delivered, including directly, foreign secretary—and anything weak. put secretary state similar question one put prime minister 23 january: course want diplomatic solution—any ramping military solution consequences—but many months secretary state government going allow continue? government allies plan? course, whole world working overall context middle east. know. gentleman seen reports weekend discussions taking place relation hostages. want comprehensive settlement;

new vertical launch system rectify, agree urgent operational requirement introduce guided multiple launch rocket systems new precision- strike missile would allow royal navy, already tasked red sea, help eliminate houthi threat? always good reasons introduce new capabilities. fact, recently hms somerset devonport, system fitted trialled. case, sometimes characterised, using typhoons another option; first preference work way range reasons cannot enter dispatch box. worth noting carried actions iraq syria, planes flew way, aware anybody saying facilities closer hand. using correct facilities particular operation, notwithstanding fact always nice new facilities. agree secretary state must always think servicemen women carry tasks. former defence minister, news defence secretary agree strikes, perhaps defence secretary power predecessors. policy strategy behind set circumstances? number defence committee members met defence minister italy weeks ago rome. italy deploying

british consumers. mentioned comments, globally 80% goods move sea;, 90%, given island. important therefore show, purposes deterrence weaken houthis' ability attack shipping, mean business say cannot carry. four separate strikes seven weeks, appears prolonged military campaign, ask minister, february: long- term strategy, relate ongoing precarious situation yemen? government' plan sustain military action, speak prime minister ensure accordingly vote say, right? hope. lady join welcoming action houthis, attacked ship that—as mentioned—has provided aid people yemen multiple occasions. know make mistake, people think houthis somehow yemeni authorities.; government. destroying country actions, actually preventing aid getting people yemen, absolutely right take action. assure. lady, previous three attacks seven days apart; longer period time. able wait longer, perhaps houthis fewer options attack shipping, stress continue carry attacking shipping. simplest thing send clear, message houthis must stop attacking innocent shipping. secretary state absolutely right say military action necessary sufficient deal long- term problem houthis. mentioned necessity tackling financing illegal shipping weapons, global shipping peculiarly vulnerable cyber- attack. secretary state ensure' cyber- capabilities shared international partners protect global shipping interests? essentially two

dup members actions taken, pointed, happening affect businesses consumers inflation inability get supplies. however, effects limited; almost every european nation relies shipping lanes kept open. heavy lifting comes attacking houthis, nations joining? first, grateful support right. gentleman' party. secondly, two factors play order take action: capability. quite large number nations involved,
